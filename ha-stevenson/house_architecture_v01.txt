PREFACE. 

I began this book ten years ago during an interval in the 
practice of my profession. Many causes have delayed its 
completion, foremost among which was a sense of the 
inadequacy and imperfection of what I had written. The 
constant engagements of an architect made it difficult for 
me to give to the book the time needed to make it satis- 
factory. At the same time I was unwilling to lose the 
labour and the cost already expended. A consequence of 
the time the writing of the book has occupied is that many 
of the views it advocates, which were unusual when they 
were written, are now current and fashionable. I believe 
that the book may still be useful. Though inadequate, it 
is not, I hope, misleading. Throughout it, while stating 
my own opinions, I have tried to give the reader data for 
judging for himself. 

The illustrations have been one cause of the delay in 
publishing. They are all from wood blocks, which give 
more satisfactory results than some modern processes, not 
being liable to the imperfect printing of the lines in parts 
which is apt to occur in these. Most of the illustrations 
have been drawn on the wood by Mr. H. W. Brewer, some 
from my own sketches, but the greater part from his. The 
illustration of the Colosseum at Rome was drawn on the 
wood for me by Mr. Mac Whirter, A.R.A. 

The drawings have been cut on the wood by several 
engravers, including Mr. Cooper, Mr. Walmsley, Mr. 
Morison, Miss MacLaren, and Mr. Pitt, Miss Bateman, and 


--page vi

some others on the staff of the 'Graphic,' to all of whom I 
feel under obligation for the careful way in which the cuts 
have been executed. I venture to think that some of them 
deserve a high place among modern examples of the art of 
wood engraving. 

I am indebted for the use of a number of the cuts to the 
kindness of the Proprietors of the 'Graphic' to Mr. George 
Godwin of the 'Builder' and to Mr. James Parker of Oxford 
for those from his father's work on 'English Domestic 
Architecture in the Middle Ages' and the examples of the 
Orders from Rickman's 'Gothic Architecture.' In two 
or three cases where the same cut illustrates different 
parts of the text, I have repeated it to save the reader the 
trouble of looking it up in a different part of the book.

HOUSE ARCHITECTURE.

CHAPTER I. 



INTRODUCTORY.

TO build a house for oneself is an excellent education 
in architecture. By the time it is finished, and the 
owner has lived in it, he feels how much better a house 
he could build with the experience he has acquired, if he 
had to do it over again. While the work is going on his 
attention is called to questions he had never thought of 
before, which are now of the greatest interest to him. He 
examines the houses of his friends, and discovers features 
in them which he wishes, when too late, he had introduced 
in his own plans. The designs are altered and the cost 
increased. His taste in architecture, and his ideas about 
planning are changed by his new experience ; the building 
is too far advanced to adopt the improvements, and the 
house which he had hoped would be perfect, is a source of 
trouble and disappointment. 

He could build another house to his mind, but to go 
through the experience once in a lifetime is enough for 
most people. 


--page 2

To have, before commencing the building of a new 
house, the knowledge which the experience of building 
gives in some imperfect and fragmentary way at the end of 
the process, would save the owner trouble, expense, and 
after-regret. To attempt to supply this is the object of 
this book. 

I do not imagine that any information I can give can 
supersede the services of an architect. It can no more do 
this than a treatise on medicine enables us to do without 
a doctor. Book knowledge is useless in practice without the 
tact, gained only by experience, when and how to apply it. 
But architects have frequently told me that they wished 
they had such a book as this which they could put 
into the hands of their employers; as one of their great 
difficulties is, that those for whom they are working do 
not understand what is meant by the plans, and after they 
are executed find out that the result is not what they 
wanted. If the employer could have understood what 
was proposed, and the results which were possible, mis- 
understanding and disappointment would frequently have 
been avoided. 

I shall try to treat of all matters connected with the 
building of a house, so that any one may understand them 
and have grounds for forming his own opinion. This will 
involve the discussion of questions interesting to numbers 
who have no intention of ever building a house. It 
will necessitate, as one important branch of investigation, 
an account of Architecture ; some inquiry as to its meaning 
and aims, the principles on which its rules are founded, 
and its uses. To attempt to discuss these questions would 
be useless without some brief statement of the effects which 
Architecture has aimed at, and has succeeded in producing 
in various countries. 

We must inquire into the conditions, social and intellec- 
tual, under which Architecture produced its triumphs, and 


--page 3

whether we may hope for satisfactory results, under the 
conditions under which we work at the present time. 

A question which must be settled before commencing a 
house, is the style of architecture it is to be built in. Till 
about fifty years ago, this question did not arise ; there was 
only one style in which people could build, that prevalent 
at the time. Since the modern Gothic revival, architects 
and all who care for Architecture have been divided as to 
whether we should adopt Gothic for our houses, or the 
Classic style, which before that revival had been universally 
used. Possibly neither of them may be quite suitable for 
us. The question cannot be satisfactorily decided without 
examining all the styles which we might reasonably employ 
with a view to our modern wants and necessities. 

Apart from its practical use, such a discussion is interest- 
ing, on its own account, to all who care for Architecture ; 
and even those who think the subject technical and dull 
may find that it is of genuine human interest. The old 
styles of Architecture were the natural outcome of the 
character and history of the nations who invented them, 
and are among the most reliable and interesting records of 
their social condition and modes of thought. Each of them 
was formed by a gradual process of development, which it is 
most interesting to trace. Architecture has of late years 
become a subject of interest, and every one feels he should 
know something of it. Truer and more practical knowledge 
of it, more widely diffused, might give us again houses 
characterised by good taste and beauty, like those of former 
times, in place of the dulness and vulgar pretentiousness 
which disfigure our streets and landscapes. 


The second volume treats of the planning and arrange- 
ment of houses, building materials, and the conveniences 
and mechanical contrivances which our modern notions of 
comfort demand. To get a perfectly satisfactory plan is of 


--page 4

all matters the most important in building a house. House- 
planning is an art derived through long tradition, and, 
to understand it, we must trace its history, which is full 
of interest, for it is the history of home life and social 
habits. 

To plan rightly we must know what experience has 
shown to be requisite in modern house-planning. 

Before we can combine the various rooms and offices 
together into one house, we must understand the purpose 
of each, and the best form and size for that purpose. The 
family living-rooms, the servants' offices, and the passages 
and stairs connecting them, will each form the subject of a 
chapter, before treating of the best ways of arranging and 
combining these together. 

There is a short chapter on the number of stories and 
height of houses in different circumstances, and another on 
the usual plan of town houses. 

To attempt a technical treatise on building materials 
and construction would be impossible in our space, and 
useless for our purpose ; but some information is necessary 
on the kind of materials we can have at our command, 
and the right way of using them, so as to produce a good 
architectural effect in form and colour. 

When the house is built it must be warmed and 
ventilated, supplied with water, a system of drainage, and 
various mechanical contrivances, such as bells, speak- 
ing tubes, and lifts, for convenience or to save servants' 
labour. These matters will form the subject of a chapter. 

As a house is not complete internally without decoration 
and furniture, nor externally, without its surrounding 
terraces, gardens and pleasure grounds, a complete treatise 
on house architecture ought to include chapters on these 
subjects. They were in part written, but the preparation 
of proper illustrations would have still farther postponed 
this publication, already too long delayed. 


--page 5

These questions will be better discussed with reference 
to a house in the country, where there is some space and 
freedom of arrangement, than if we are bound by the 
stereotyped arrangements of town houses. 

Every one of them has of late years been a subject of 
interest and discussion ; and information is to be got with 
regard to all of them in magazine articles, and in books 
large and small. The literature of the subject is too 
extensive for easy acquirement or handy reference, and to 
be of practical use to any one building a house, it requires 
to be digested, and the conflicting views which abound 
on every point stated and compared. For any one without 
practical experience of building operations this process 
would be difficult, and the results probably wrong. Some 
notice of the more important works on these subjects will 
indicate the gap which this book is intended to fill. 

Mr. Ruskin, in his 'Seven Lamps of Architecture,' and 
in his 'Stones of Venice,' has discussed with eloquence 
and insight the fundamental principles of Architecture, the 
value of the art to us, and the style we ought to adopt for 
modern use. By these and other writings he has inspired 
his generation with enthusiasm for art, and for nobleness 
and beauty in architecture. I do not know how far he 
holds to the views expressed in these works, as since their 
publication he has modified some of his opinions. In them 
the subject is treated too often from the point of view of 
Italy to be practically useful or true of England. I think 
some of his views on architecture are open to question, and 
that their practical influence on modern architecture has to 
some extent been mischievous. 


Mr. Fergusson, in his 'History of Architecture,' gives a 
clear and interesting account of all the great styles of 
architecture which have existed in the world. His 
three volumes form a complete text-book of great 


--page 6

value. He describes the historical buildings of each style, 
especially those which are landmarks in the history of 
art, and criticises them with ability and knowledge, and 
with the confidence which springs from the consciousness 
of their possession; pointing out faults, and suggesting 
how the architect should have made his design so as to 
avoid them. 

I do not think he is always successful, but the task he 
sets himself is difficult. We do not require a critic when 
he finds fault with a poem to put it right by composing 
passages to replace those he objects to. 

It is, perhaps, a task beyond human ability to re-design 
the great buildings of the different styles of architecture, 
for it implies greater insight and architectural invention 
than their architects possessed. Trying to work out in 
several instances the results of Mr. Fergusson's proposed 
improvements on historical buildings, I have found either 
that they altered the intention of the design, or introduced 
some new difficulty which it is not unreasonable to 
suppose the designer had appreciated and avoided. In 
criticism it is at least safer, and perhaps more instructive, 
instead of suggesting alterations, to take the buildings as 
they are, and try to realise their meaning and the impres- 
sion they were intended to produce. 

Throughout the work, Mr. Fergusson contrasts the con- 
ditions under which these old styles grew up with our 
modern method of producing architecture, which he insists 
we must abandon and return to the old, if the art is to 
flourish. This question is of interest to all who care for 
architecture, and especially to architects, as it involves their 
existence. 


About twenty years ago. Sir Gilbert Scott published a 
little book on 'Secular and Domestic Architecture, Present 
and Future,' to show how suitable the Gothic style of 


--page 7

architecture is for our houses and public buildings. Since 
then the principles he advocated have largely influenced 
our architecture, and have been adopted even by our 
ordinary builders, but the result has not been all that could 
be wished. 

Difficulties not anticipated have shown themselves in 
adapting the style to modern use, and there is a feeling that 
the question whether Gothic is the most suitable style of 
architecture for modern domestic use needs reconsideration. 

Since Sir Gilbert Scott's lamented death his lectures 
to the students of the Royal Academy, which he had 
previously prepared for publication, have been published in 
two volumes full of admirable illustrations of English 
mediæval ecclesiastical architecture. The lectures, which 
were delivered at intervals during fourteen years, are not 
a consecutive treatise. They give the results of the author's 
life-long enthusiastic study of mediaeval church architecture, 
especially in England. His knowledge of buildings, from 
cathedrals to village churches, was unsurpassed, and it is 
used in discussing the interesting questions of the develop- 
ment and principles of Gothic architecture. These form 
a small part of the subject of this book, which would 
be incomplete without a reference to Sir Gilbert Scott’s 
views. 

In his pleasant book, ‘Hints on Household Taste,’ 
Mr. Eastlake expresses his conviction that the “Gothic 
Renaissance” is a reformation slowly but surely taking 
place in this country, and urges the adoption of Gothic for 
our houses and for our furniture, even in ordinary Classic 
houses. His own designs in the book for decoration and 
furniture are in the Gothic style, but in the illustrations 
from old work, he shows an incipient liking for the more 
picturesque forms of the Classic style, which, I have reason 
to believe time has not diminished. 


--page 8

For the history of domestic architecture in England in 
the Middle Ages, the work commenced by Mr. Hudson 
Turner, and continued by Mr. Parker, is exhaustive. I 
have availed myself largely of it in giving the history of 
house-planning, and by Mr. J. Parker's kindness I have 
been allowed the use of several of the woodcuts for these 
volumes. 

There are three systems of arrangement of the matter of 
the book — by subjects, by centuries, and by counties, so that 
parts of the same subject turn up at wide intervals — it is 
difficult to remember where. It is really a collection of 
valuable notes of interesting facts of mediaeval life in all 
its phases, and a copious index gets over the difficulty of 
arrangement. 


On the subject of the planning of houses, 'The English 
Gentleman's House' by Professor Kerr, contains about all 
that need be known. The book is large and would bear 
condensation. In the chapters on planning I have endea- 
voured to go over the same ground. I shall have occasion 
sometimes to refer to it, as I cannot always agree with 
the statements and recommendations contained in it. Mr. 
Kerr devotes a small portion of it to the subject of archi- 
tectural style. He suggests as the answer of the English 
gentleman, when his architect asks him in what style he 
wishes his house built? "In no style at all, except the 
comfortable style if there be one," and, "Take me as I 
am, and build my house in my own style." He gives, 
however, as samples for the gentleman to choose from, the 
same plan done up in ten different styles — Elizabethan, 
and revived Elizabethan, Palladian, rural Italian, Palatial 
Italian, and French Italian, the English Renaissance style, 
the Mediaeval or Gothic style, the Cottage style, and the 
Scotch Baronial style. 

The feat is a difficult one; something like translating 


--page 9

a piece of poetry into ten different languages. Mr. Kerr’s 
designs fail in giving the nicer characteristics of the 
various styles, but this would have been too much to 
expect from one author. They have all a family likeness, 
due no doubt to their common parentage. They remind 
me of a fish dinner at which, cod, skate, and haddock 
all tasted the same, having been all cooked with the same 
lard. 


Sir Edmund Beckett has given the public the benefit of 
some of his extensive experience as a builder and amateur 
architect, in a little book which he calls, 'A Book on Build- 
ing,' in which his aim is to give practical information to 
those intending to build, how to avoid legal and structural 
mistakes. The subject of house-building occupies a con- 
siderable part of it, not treated in a systematic way, but by 
instances of the mistakes which, in his experience, builders 
and architects are liable to commit. The book does not 
profess to be a systematic treatise, and assumes the necessity 
of architects. The arrangement is somewhat heteroge- 
neous ; such diverse subjects as kitchen grates, skylights, 
oak graining (which the author approves of), and windows 
all being treated of together. It goes into minute detail on 
some points, but I doubt if the information and directions 
are sufficient to enable an employer, who had not the 
practical experience of the author, to keep from error an 
architect who did not know his business. It leaves a 
strong impression of the risk which any one runs in build- 
ing, unless he superintends his architect not only in making 
the plans, but in carrying out the work. 

The first chapter treats of agreements with architects and 
builders, giving model forms of contract, to prevent the 
employer surrendering his authority over the work, and 
controverts the doctrine which, it seems, is held by some 
architects that, "after the plans are settled and the work 


--page 10

commenced, the 'client' must yield himself absolutely to his 
professional adviser." It is reasonable rather that as he 
pays his money he should have his choice. Employers 
may sometimes insist on things in a building which an 
architect could not carry out consistently with his own 
credit. But it is seldom that the employer’s wishes, 
though they may not be what the architect thinks best, 
cannot be worked into the design. 

One plan of a house is given, which Sir Edmund Beckett 
designed for himself. It has a central hall lighted from 
the ceiling and contains many of the usual modern arrange- 
ments, but the want of facility in getting over difficulties, 
not uncommon in the work of amateurs, may be detected 
in parts, and a single instance is in any case insufficient 
to give an adequate idea of house-planning. 

The views expressed by the author are always decided, 
and many of them are the same as my own experience had 
led me to form. In judging of the architectural merit of 
buildings he takes, as we must all do, his own taste as 
the standard, with too little appreciation, perhaps, of the 
possibility of a different opinion in others. 

The book also contains chapters on the theory of domes 
and on the great pyramid. 


The late M. Viollet-le-Duc, the author of the admirable 
'Dictionary of French Mediæval Architecture,' recently pub- 
lished a charming little book, which has been translated into 
English, under the title of 'How to Build a House.' The 
title is somewhat deceptive; the French title, 'L'Histoire 
d'une Maison,' describes the contents more accurately. 

It would not help any one in building an English house. 
The conditions of building are those of French country parts, 
where the materials and modes of work differ from ours in 
England. The plan is eminently French; no isolation of 


--page 11

the public rooms, but all opening one into another, the 
bedrooms sufficient only for the limited size of French 
families; the whole nursery accommodation in a house 
which costs £6000 being a small bedroom over the kitchen. 

The book, in plan a novelette, is a pleasantly told lesson 
on the principles of common-sense architecture. A lad, idle 
at home during the German war, is set, under the guidance 
of his cousin, an architect, to build a house as a surprise for 
his sister on her return from her marriage jaunt. Knowing 
architecture only from the treatises on the five orders 
in his father's library, he had thought it a dreary subject, 
but his interest is awakened by being taught by practical 
experience how every feature of architecture springs from 
use and convenience. It is not shown, however, how 
pointed arches, and some other features introduced into the 
design of the house, spring from any necessity of construc- 
tion or use. The book is an excellent one for creating an 
interest in the subject. 

The same author had recently published another book 
also translated into English, under the title of 'The Habi- 
tations of Man in All Ages,' also in form a novelette. Two 
"beings" with an interest in house building visit, after the 
manner of the Wandering Jew, the various countries of the 
world, beginning with the times of the cave men, and 
taking leave of us at a dinner at a Paris restaurant in the 
days of the Second Empire. One of the companions is con- 
servative, the other in favour of the successive improve- 
ments in the construction of dwellings which they come 
across in their large experience. Both are rather bores, 
while the descriptions and pictures of the houses they see 
are, like the celebrated treatise of the author's countryman 
on the camel, drawn largely from his own imagination. 
The addition of the data, if any, on which they are founded, 
would have made the book of more value. It does not 
profess to treat of modern houses. 


--page 12

M. Viollet-le-Duc's 'Dictionary of Gothic Architecture' is 
well known in this country, where the greater favour for 
this style has made it more popular than in France. 

It is a complete encyclopædia of French mediæval archi- 
tecture, containing admirable treatises on its principles and 
history, and on the arts connected with it; every detail 
being explained and illustrated with a wealth of knowledge, 
which seems to include every example of the style. I have 
been largely indebted to it for a knowledge of Gothic archi- 
tecture in its history, its principles, and its forms. The 
illustrations are very clever, well drawn and well cut on the 
wood. In their style, clean and sharp and rather thin, they 
suggest modern Gothic, and they somehow impart an air 
of modern Gothic to all the buildings, even the Classic ones, 
which they illustrate. The pointing of the stones is always 
carefully shown, which gives an air of surface and reality to 
the drawings. 

It is possibly on account of its success in the drawings 
that M. Viollet-le-Duc has occasionally in his restorations 
applied the same process to the buildings themselves, by 
filling in the joints of the stones with black mortar, making 
the interior a net-work of black lines. This is not what the 
old builders intended. In the desire to show the construc- 
tion the architecture is lost. M. Viollet-le-Duc was more 
successful as an author than as an architect. 


Information on all the subjects I purpose to treat can be 
found in the Cyclopaedias and Dictionaries of Architecture, 
such as Gwilt's 'Encyclopædia,' or Raynaud's 'Traite d' Archi- 
tecture,' Paris 1863. The former, even in its later editions, 
is somewhat out of date in its information and its views. 
The short chapter on house-planning takes as a standard 
houses about a century old — in its criticism of buildings it 
judges of their merits according to their Classic purity. 

Raynaud's book is more modern and thorough, but it is 


--page 13

based on French practice, and is an unsafe guide for English 
methods of work. Such books are of more use as books 
of reference to the profession than for teaching beginners, 
for which purpose an alphabetical arrangement is un- 
satisfactory. 

On the important subjects of draining, ventilation, 
heating, &amp;c., many treatises have lately been published, 
advocating different systems, and inventions are constantly 
advertised, which it would be tedious to enumerate. I have 
attempted to explain the principles of systems which have 
proved successful in practice. 

There is justification, I think, for a book which aims to 
collect together all that need be said on these subjects, for 
ordinary practical purposes. On each of them books have 
been written, but what is essential to be known may, I 
think, be given within a few chapters. 

As I do not presume to teach the profession, but only the 
unlearned, I shall try to avoid technical terms, taking 
nothing for granted, but deducing everything from common 
first principles. 

In former days, when the old styles of architecture 
flourished, there was no occasion for such investigation of 
the principles and practice of these arts, for each age had 
only one way of working in them ; all others being either 
inconceivable or false. The only difference consisted in 
doing better or worse the same things in the same way ; 
and the changes of style were so gradual, like those of 
natural growth, that though obvious when measured over 
centuries, they were unnoticed as they occurred. 

We have cut ourselves loose from tradition. Instead of 
accepting and trustfully following the ways and customs 
handed down to us, we claim to be absolute judges of right, 
and make our individual preferences laws. It would need 


--page 14

omniscience not to fail. It may be some explanation of 
this state of matters with regard to architecture, that since 
the Middle Ages closed, the same uncertainty has prevailed 
in other matters. In religion, philosophy, politics, even 
in morals, as well as in architecture, it seems as if the 
grounds of our faith had to be settled anew. We cannot, 
as of old, trust the experts, for they are not themselves 
agreed. The thread of tradition has been cut, and in these, 
as in architecture, there are now no authoritative standards 
or articles of faith to which appeal can be made, and 
judgment given. 

Some may be content in building to accept at hap- 
hazard the first advice that turns up ; but to form rational 
decisions, and to have an intelligent interest in the work, a 
man must understand the principles of the arts which find a 
place in it, especially of architecture in its double purpose 
of ministering to convenience and beauty. He must know 
its aims, and wherein its goodness consists — the causes of 
present failure, and the conditions necessary for success — 
and something of the nature and merits of different styles, 
if he has to decide which is best to choose. 

Till the public care more for it, and know more about it, 
we cannot look for much improvement. Why should they 
spend money, and put themselves to trouble for mere dis- 
play or to gratify whims of architects, which they neither 
appreciate nor understand ? Better take the builder's house 
with its compo-dressings and vulgar ornament. It is 
sensibly planned and seems cheap at the money. But it 
has been built to sell. The principle of construction seems 
to be that it shall be always out of repair, so as to 
provide constant work for the building trades; and that 
at the end of the lease it may be worthless to the ground 
landlord. 

The walls are thin and let in the cold and the sound even 
of conversation from the next house. But for the floor 


--page 15

timbers which tie them together, a gust of wind would 
overturn them ; the floors shake with the slightest move- 
ment; the plaster is half sand, and is kept on the walls 
mainly by the paper pasted on it ; doors and windows do 
not fit; the plumber work is bad; the smell and poison 
of the drains come in, and the water-pipes freeze ; the 
"compo" outside, imitating massive stonework, requires 
constant painting, and occasionally scales off in masses. 
Its existence is a constant process of going to pieces ; work- 
men are never out of it, and the tenant finds that to keep 
it habitable adds a third to his rent. The architecture, 
however small the house may be, is a union of vulgar 
pretentiousness and mean shams. 

The houses which men build for themselves need not 
have these faults of bad workmanship, but they are some- 
times ill planned and often ugly. The owner may have had 
every desire to make his house a charming residence, and 
have spent money ungrudgingly, but too often his hopes are 
not fulfilled. It is not perfect as he intended. If he had to 
do it over again, he would make it different. He finds, 
perhaps, that he has miscalculated his requirements, and the 
destination of the rooms has to be changed, destroying the 
cherished arrangements of the plan ; or in his desire for 
light and view, he has made his drawing-room all window — 
scorching in summer, cold in winter, and without wall space 
for the furniture ; or possibly, notwithstanding every care, 
the damp comes through the walls, some of the chimneys 
smoke, or the water-pipes freeze. Frequently he finds that 
while it was being built his taste has changed. With better 
knowledge, from the attention he has given to the matter 
since he became practically interested in building, he now 
sees how much better his house might have been ; that what 
he thought would be beautiful and grand is fantastic, or 
vulgar and pretentious ; or, if he does not see it, it may be 
none the less true. From whatever cause it arises, it is 


--page 16

generally admitted that a large proportion of modern houses 
are architectural failures. 

The art in them, such as it is, usually stops at the outside. 
Here they may have some resemblance to a mediaeval castle 
or an Italian palace, but we know that on entering we shall 
find neither the bold stone carving — the construction every- 
where apparent — the tapestry, and stained glass of the one, 
nor the marbles and frescoes of the other. Whether Classic 
or Gothic, the lobby will be painted in imitation of marble 
or granite ; the dining-room with a plain tint of light 
green, and a whitewashed ceiling ; the drawing-room paper 
of the last fashionable pattern ; the bedrooms as common- 
place as those of an hotel ; the carpets attempting to look 
an uneven surface of holes we would stumble in, and 
bunches of flowers we would crush in walking over ; the 
furniture a mass of unmeaning curves ; the pictures mere 
furniture, and no part of the architecture. In both there 
are the same gigantic mirrors, and great plate-glass 
windows with muslin curtains, occasionally, perhaps, a 
few old buffets or carved chairs from Wardour Street — 
reminiscences of the time when the same art and style 
governed not only the outside architecture of the house, but 
its internal decorations and everything it contained. 

In old times it was not so. A man was certain in 
building to get his money's worth in art. Every old house 
is interesting, not because it is old, but because it is good. 
The style of one age may be better than another, but all are 
good in their way. The houses of Pompeii were all works 
of art; so are the few remains of Romanesque domestic 
architecture, at Cluny and elsewhere. Old Gothic houses 
of every period of the style are beautiful. Our streets are 
not to be compared in beauty with those of Venice, even in 
their decay, with all their colour gone, or in picturesqueness 
with those of Nuremberg (frontispiece), which was no better 
than many another city of its day, but has had the good 


--page 17

fortune to have been preserved till now from modern altera- 
tions. For the charm of homeliness nothing can surpass 
the houses of the Tudor age, with their mullioned windows 
and oak-carving ; and we can only feebly imitate the 
sumptuousness and elegance of those of the Renaissance of 
Francis I., or of our own Jacobean. Some may be better 
than others, but there are no failures such as we now 
constantly see produced. All are good architecture of their 
kind, not great mansions only, but farmhouses and cottages 
in village streets. And these results were accomplished, not 
by a specially educated profession, like the architects of the 
present day, directing the tradesmen by means of drawings 
and instructions, but by common tradesmen themselves, 
without any superintendence. Every village mason could 
build houses and churches such as for excellence and 
accuracy in architectural style we vainly now, with all our 
knowledge, attempt to imitate. Every village carpenter 
could make furniture more beautiful and in truer taste 
than the best town-made nowadays — solid in construction, 
graceful in line, and rich in carving. 

As for house-painting, we have ceased, justly enough, 
perhaps, to consider it an art. We do not look on those 
painters as artists who work on the walls of our rooms. 
Every London builder thinks himself competent to design 
and execute decoration. Some call themselves plumbers 
and decorators, and one large London upholstering firm 
advertises that it includes decoration in its house agency 
department. Cheesemonger and decorator would be about 
as congruous. We prefer to give artistic work to "prac- 
tical men," as they are called, that is, to those who know 
nothing about the subject. 

In old time people thought great artists were the proper 
men to do the work — Michael Angelo and Raphael were 
proud to be wall-decorators. If our houses are to be works 
of art, they must possess not only outside beauty, architec- 


--page 18

tural proportions, and good colour, the artistic expression 
of their purpose and of modern life, not of uses and habits 
long extinct, but they must have the same qualities, the 
same art, inside, in all their decorations and furnishing. 
We copy only one part, and that the least important in 
the general effect of former systems of architecture — the 
stone mouldings and ornaments which time happens to have 
left to us — omitting the decoration, and making the furniture 
discordant, because in the buildings we copy from the one 
happens to have perished and the other to be removed. 

To be really a high work of art, a house must not only 
be beautiful outside, and all its surroundings in harmony, 
but inside there must be not only no shams and meannesses, 
but good art throughout ; the walls and ceilings rich in 
colour and in art expression ; paintings as good as art 
can make them, their decoration — a part of them — not 
hung on them by strings ; the sculpture only the decora- 
tion of the architecture, the crowning points of its ornament 
or the enrichment of its surface, and in thus aiding it, 
acquiring an interest it never has when thinking only 
of itself; the furniture good in construction, graceful in 
its lines, and in harmony with the architecture ; all the 
resources of art and manufacture, carpets, rich hangings, 
stained glass, gilding, carving, painting, good as art, and 
ministering to one harmonious effect. 

The thing has been. The houses of Pompeii were 
second-rate performances in their age, but for wealth of art 
throughout them, and unity of design down to the smallest 
details, our richest mansions cannot compare with them. 

A few battered buildings pulled about and altered, their 
furniture removed long since, when their old owners left 
them, a scrap of colour here and there on the walls, telling 
that they once glowed with it, are all that remains to us of 
the houses of the Middle Ages. 

But in their churches we can still trace the evidence of 


--page 19

what architecture then meant. Their windows here and 
there, as at York, or Bourges, or Chartres, still show us a 
splendour of colour in their stained glass which, but for 
them, we should never have dreamt of; the marble pillars 
remain ; in places the floor, after the treading of forty 
generations, still glows with rich patterns of coloured tiles, 
and, under accumulated coats of whitewash, every now and 
then we discover traces of the painting which once covered 
their walls, was concentrated in brightness on the tombs 
and altars, and culminated on the ceiling; great crowns 
suspended from the roofs, studded with jewels and sparkling 
with lights ; vestments, hangings, and furniture, admirable 
in colour and design, all uniting in producing an effect of 
rich, glowing splendour, of which these churches now are 
but the grey, white skeletons. The tiled floors and stained 
glass remain, for the colour in them was in imperishable 
material; but they are only isolated scraps of a system of 
decoration which pervaded the whole building. Floors 
and windows are the last parts of a room we should think 
of colouring. The object in using encaustic tiles and 
stained glass was merely to carry out over windows and 
floors the colouring of the other parts of the building; and 
we think we are reviving mediaeval art when we copy these 
only, and leave the walls and ceiling cold stone, or raw, 
grey plaster. 

It is of some interest to investigate the reasons why art 
in our houses is so hopeless and helpless, so often mere 
failure, and its greatest successes only bad imitations of the 
art which nations and periods inferior to us in wealth and 
resources produced constantly and naturally, and without 
apparent effort. 

It may be that the present degraded state of house-build- 
ing is inevitable ; that we must submit to see the country 
covered with miles of dismal, uninteresting streets, and 
spotted over with villas which violate good taste and 


--page 20

destroy its beauty, and be content with houses which make 
our lives in them a succession of annoyances; but if a 
remedy is to be found, the first step must be to know the 
causes which have produced our failure. 

There are indications of a prevalent desire for a better 
state of things ; and a knowledge of the objects to be aimed 
at, and the results attainable, in convenience and beauty, in 
a house and its belongings, may prevent a waste of effort 
in wrong directions, along paths by which advancement is 
impossible — may give higher and truer aims to those who 
are building for themselves, and, in time, might even 
improve the houses built on speculation by diffusing better 
taste, and creating a preference for houses sounder in con- 
struction and less vulgar in style. 

It is not because we are too poor that our buildings now 
cannot attempt to rival, in completeness and splendour of 
art, those of Greece or Rome, or of the Middle Ages. 
Nor is it even from our unwillingness to spend money. 
I suppose no age ever supported a greater number of 
artists, not in comfort merely, but in wealth. I certainly 
do not grudge it them, for none know better how to spend 
it. Besides those artists whom we know, who furnish the 
walls of the principal exhibitions, there is an innumerable 
company whose names we never hear, who turn out moon- 
lights, or mills, or mountain scenery with the regularity of 
manufacture, and somehow find a continuous sale. There 
are miles on miles of new pictures exhibited each year, 
which must get sold somehow, or the supply would cease. 
Sculpture, perhaps, is more a drug in the market; though 
the number of British Philistines and others who each 
year have their features immortalised in imperishable 
marble is considerable — much greater than those we see 
ranged close in rows like gallipots on shelves in exhibitions. 
And of expenditure on architecture there is certainly no 
stint. Old churches are pulled down for the mere pleasure 


--page 21

of building new ones (more’s the pity) ; new town halls, 
law courts, country houses, town mansions, clubs, churches, 
colleges, are rising everywhere — in many cases the building 
motive being the desire of increased magnificence, and the 
pleasure of building, rather than the necessity ; and to this 
expenditure I object, of course, still less than to that on 
easel pictures. But are the results satisfactory ? are the 
churches as good as old ones ? Do the mansions in town 
or country approach in beauty, in completeness of art, 
those of the times of the Tudors or Stuarts ? Does the 
result in the club-houses justify the money spent on 
them ? It is not sufficient answer to point to one or two 
perfect houses or churches among the thousands built. In 
the old times there were none bad. They may not show 
originality, or genius, or cleverness; but from palace to 
cottage they are natural and harmonious throughout, and 
yet they were no doubt built by common builders, for 
architects were not thought of, except for the most important 
works. 

There was a sense of art in the people, which did not need 
grand buildings or great expenditure for its manifestation, 
but showed itself in the cheapest and commonest structures. 
Here is a mere shed for holding ladders at a small German 
village (fig. 1, next page), which shows the old instinct, 
which we seem to have lost, to make the commonest things 
interesting and pleasing. 

Nowadays, except in rare and special instances, our 
buildings are bad and inartistic. And these special buildings 
are all imitations, more or less perfect, of old work. 

It is of little use asking who is to blame. The most 
obvious answer is, that it is the architects themselves, and 
the most obvious remedy, to hang a few of them ; but the 
answer, though simple, is only half true, and the remedy, 
though severe, would be inadequate. The evil is not so 
much ignorance of architecture on the part either of its 


--page 22

professors or the public, for every one with any pretensions 
to taste knows something about it, has read Ruskin, and 
considers himself (or herself) a judge ; and never in the 
world’s history were there so many styles understood and 
practised, more or less correctly. It may be that we know 
too much about architectural styles — that the variety of our 
knowledge confuses us, and prevents us doing what would 
be natural — that our restlessness prevents us sticking to 
any one of them till we have perfected it, and made it our 
own. Or our wealth, instead of helping us, may be the 

--figure 1. Shed for ladders at Hochberg, near Würzburg. 

cause of our failure. We may be so devoted to its acquisi- 
tion that we have no time left to learn how to spend 
it; for money alone can no more give us art than it 
can give us learning. Or we may not really care for art — 
paying for it, not that we like it, but because we think 
our position in society requires a certain amount of dis- 
play, which bad art will satisfy as well as good. Or the 
character of our buildings, as in all architectural styles, 
may merely express the character of the people who 
produce them; the display of magnificence in coarse 


--page 23

form and cheap material be the natural outcome of our 
vulgarity; the attempts to make things look, not what 
they are, but like something else which is thought 
grander — as a row of little houses clubbing together 
with the help of stucco ornaments so as to look like 
a palace, or a dwelling-house with a quarter of an acre 
of ground from which the owner goes up to business 
every morning, and where the newspaper is delivered 
before breakfast, frowning with battlements, and making 
believe as if it held the country round in serfdom — may 
be the reflex of our pretentiousness and falsity, and signs 
that in our hearts we are ashamed of ourselves. 

No doubt all this is partly true, but not, I believe, to the 
extent which the universality almost of such qualities in 
the architecture would indicate ; for I think it can be 
shown that the conditions under which architecture works 
at present in this country give a facility and amount of 
expresssion to such qualities altogether disproportionate to 
their prevalence among the people. 

The subject has really a greater than mere dilettante 
interest. Though we may not be conscious of it, it is no 
slight evil that the houses in which the greatest portion of 
the people live are built independently of art at all, or in 
defiance of it. Within the last twenty or thirty years 
whole towns have come into existence, which exhibit what 
seems a new characteristic in the human race — namely, 
utter disregard to the beauty of their dwellings. Never, 
so far as I know, have there been collections of human 
habitations so dismal, so completely without one artistic 
quality, or consequently so inhuman, as the miles on miles 
of uniform streets in our new manufacturing towns. The 
hut of the savage is at least picturesque ; for love for the 
beautiful — a desire to ornament and turn into objects of art 
the things they use — has hitherto been a characteristic of 
all men, even the most degraded. 


--page 24

If a town is old, however poor, it is sure to have some 
beauty or interest; if new, we look for neither, but get out 
of it as soon as we can. 

Those who live among this ugliness possibly feel it no 
hardship. If so, it only means that it has entered their 
souls, and that they are losing one of the characteristics of 
humanity ; and it is a question, whether the intense rest- 
lessness of modern life is not aggravated by the places we 
live in, even where art is attempted, being so devoid of any 
beauty which can give lasting satisfaction. 


--page 25

CHAPTER II. 

WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ARCHITECTURE?


THIS question has of late years, in this country, been 
obscured and rendered almost impossible of answer 
by the rivalry of competing styles. One party would 
almost say that good Architecture is Gothic architecture, 
the other that it is Classic. But some specimens so bad in 
both styles have been perpetrated, that even their own 
friends cannot acknowledge them. 

Not only may architecture be good or bad in any style, 
but it is essentially the same qualities that render it so in 
every style. 

Architecture is simply the useful art of building elevated 
to a fine art, following the tendency which all human beings 
have to make articles of use beautiful as well. Out of the 
same instinct, in all ages, the necessity of clothing has de- 
veloped the art of dress. On the oldest pottery there is 
ornament, and carvings on bone utensils have been found 
coeval with the elk and the reindeer in France. No 
amount of decoration was thought too great in any tribe for 


--page 26

their weapons, axes, clubs, and swords : what was always 
beside them they wished to be beautiful ; and when they 
became settled, they ornamented their houses from the 
same motive. But they also built houses for their gods; 
and Architecture, with religion as a motive-power, has had 
a higher and more poetic development than it could have 
had in merely ministering to human wants. 

As the art to begin with is a useful one, that a building 
should be good architecturally, the first condition is that it 
should serve its purpose — houses must be suited to the wants 
and habits of their inhabitants ; castles must be strong ; 
churches and temples adapted to the worship or the rites 
celebrated in them. 

Again, as it is a structural art, consisting in putting 
materials together for a certain purpose, the second essential 
of good architecture is good construction — disposing the 
materials in the best form for strength and stability. 

Thus far we have merely good building ; to become archi- 
tecture, which is a fine art, the element of beauty or of 
artistic expression must be added. From the first dawn 
of civilisation all building was architectural. It has been 
reserved for our age to find out that beauty in our dwell- 
ings is not worth striving for, that material wants are all 
that need be attended to. 

Various means have been used for arranging and treating 
buildings so as to add to them the element of art, and so 
make them architectural. Some nations covered them with 
ornament wherever they could put it. But, though this 
practice is not without advocates and examples in our day, 
it is unthinking and savage art. 

An illustration in Mr. Owen Jones’s 'Grammar of Orna- 
ment,' of the tattooed face of a New Zealander, shows how 
hideous may be the results, even of ornament in itself 
beautiful, when used in the wrong place ; and the same effect 
would be produced in architecture, though not perhaps so 


--page 27

strikingly, if a Doric column were covered with ornament 
instead of the flutings which mark its purpose. 

Architecture, to attain its highest development, must have 
something more than mere ornament — the intellectual 
qualities of proportion and expression. This is true of all 
arts : music is proportion in sounds ; painting is proportion 
in colour and forms ; and architecture, proportion of masses, 
of solids and voids. But to constitute true art there must 
be something more, the expression of human feeling or 
character. 

That music and painting can express these, we know ; 
but that with stones and bricks, and wood and plaster, and 
while pursuing the vulgar human need of shelter, an archi- 
tect should not only express human feelings and character — 
such as power or tenderness, refinement or coarseness, 
grandeur or meanness — but his own character, seems 
strange, — stranger rather that he cannot help doing it. 
But to do this a power of architectural expression must be 
presupposed, just as a man must have the faculty of musical 
expression, to be a composer. So that to get good archi- 
tecture, what is wanted is a good architect, one who has 
the power to construct and arrange the masses and forms 
of a building, and by means of them to express nobleness 
or beauty. 

There are various ways of disposing building materials 
so as to produce artistic results. Mere height has been an 
object of architectural effort since the builders at Babel 
commenced their tower to reach to heaven, while more 
imposing even is the effect of length in endless ranges 
of columns and arcades. 

Mere mass of perpendicular windowless wall, even where 
there has been no conscious aim at architectural effect, is a 
most powerful one. It is mainly from this cause that old 
Scotch castles are so grand, while their modern imitations, 
riddled with windows, are so weak and feeble. 


--page 28

--figure 2. Tilquhillie Castle, Aberdeenshire. 

But perhaps the more powerful means of producing 
grandeur is by shadow — from great projecting cornices, or 
under deep porticoes, or in the dark recesses of great 
arches. 

To the most impressive architecture, mystery is essential 
— the feeling that there is something more than we see. 
Glory half hid is double in effect. The half, as the Greeks 
knew, is often greater than the whole. The plays of 
'Medea' and 'Macbeth" prove that this is equally true in 
dramatic art. 

Truth is essential in good architecture, as it is in all 
art, though in architecture, as in other spheres, it may be 
impossible satisfactorily to answer the old question, "What 
is Truth?" "Truth" generally means the correspondence 
of a representation with the facts; and architecture, to be 
true, must be the expression of building necessities. Con- 
venience must not be sacrificed to appearance ; materials 
must show themselves to be what they really are, and 
not something different ; the construction which appears

must be that which actually supports the building. But, in 
architecture, as in other arts, the representation must be 
artistic; not a dull, unarranged, unmodified statement of 
facts as they happen to turn up. It is tiresome to tell 
everything, as an old woman tells her story, wearisomely 
relating whether a thing happened on a Wednesday or a 
Friday, giving genealogies and dates of marriage of all the 
persons mentioned, though these have no bearing on the 
point. The object in a work of art is to convey an impres- 
sion. To this all the parts must tend, and what is irrelevant 
must be suppressed or modified. A photograph is true 
(except that the relation of light and shadow is destroyed by 
green or red and yellow all being turned to black), but even 
if it represented Nature's colour, or her relations of light 
and shade, it would not be a work of art: it is not the 
impression on the mind of an artist expressed by him in such 
a way as to impress others; it tells a great many things 
which no one is interested to know. So in architecture there 
is no need for painfully making every constructive expedient 
apparent, and bringing into prominence those meaner 
accessories of a dwelling-house, which, however essential, 
one does not care to refer to, or force on the attention. 
Language shows us that art is not a merely bare and true 
representation of facts, in the meanings it gives to "artless" 
as truthfully simple, and to "artful" as cunningly false. The 
border-line at which the production of artistic effect becomes 
falsehood must always be difficult to define. There may be 
ugly necessities of building construction, which it is right 
to conceal under beautiful forms or fine colour, as Nature 
conceals our bones and muscles under the rounded forms and 
marvellous flesh-colour of our bodies. As in these, so in 
architecture, the fundamental construction, though it need 
not be offensively obtruded, should be truly indicated ; and 
the greater the amount of truth in materials and construction 
that can be expressed without losing sight of the artistic 


--page 30

idea at which the architecture aims, the nobler is the archi- 
tecture. That of the Romans is not satisfactory. They 
ornamented buildings, in which the main construction was 
arched, with pillars and lintels borrowed from Greek 
architecture ; and 
although great 
magnificence re- 
sulted, it was never 
satisfactory, be- 
cause it was at 
bottom untrue. 
Gothic architec- 
ture, on the other 
Iiand, was truth 
itself. Happily 
for it, no other 
better architecture 
was known which 
they might have 
been tempted to 
copy for the sake 
of its beauty, and 
whatever the ma- 
terials or construc- 
tion employed, 
they were allowed 
to tell their own 
tale. 

In the course 
of their growth 
many of the older 
architectures imitated forms in stone, which had been deve- 
loped in older wooden construction, or hewed out an archi- 
tecture in solid rock, which had grown in constructions of 
built stone (fig. 3).

--page 31

Such things are interesting to trace, as illustrating the 
continuous but inconceivably slow progress of human ideas, 
but no architecture can be perfect which retains them. 
Nowadays, with the beauties of all known architectures 
available for imitation, which can seldom be natural or truth- 
ful modes of expression for us, the temptations to this form 
of falsity are almost irresistible. 

Perhaps no age has ever indulged more than our own 
in the shabbier and more vulgar form of untruthfulness, 
of attempting to make cheap, mean materials look as if they 
were rare and valuable, — painting and sanding deal boards 
so that they may pass for solid stone, or graining them to 
look like oak or rare marble ; or copying in stucco the archi- 
tecture of Italian palaces, and plastering it on common 
houses. Some people seem to think that tricks and decep- 
tions are legitimate means of producing artistic effects, such 
as making a range of small houses look as if it were one 
palace, or filling in the pillared recess at the end of a room 
with a single mirror without a frame, in the hope of making 
the room look twice as large. The deception is soon found 
out and becomes ridiculous. One house gets painted which 
includes half of some architectural ornament shared with the 
next, while the rest remain dingy ; or some stranger breaks 
his nose on the mirror by attempting to walk into the 
supposed extension of the room. The people who like 
these little tricks are often honourable and truthful. Their 
morality does not lie in the sphere of art. One of the 
honestest men I know was charmed at my mistaking a 
wooden oriel window in his house which had been skilfully 
sanded over for a stone one. His honesty lay in a different 
sphere. Just as, some artists who have a zeal for their art 
as earnest as ever burnt for religion — who pursue it for the 
love of it, independent altogether of profit — are often careless 
about getting into debt, and regard money obligations as 
altogether secondary to doing their work honestly and well. 


--page 32

In the sphere of art, truth and honesty are as essential to 
excellence as to morality ; and our only hope of freshness 
and originality in our architecture must lie in allowing it to 
express our actual necessities, with perfect naturalness and 
truth. 

Beauty, though there may be good and noble architec- 
ture without it, is essential to the highest forms of the art. 
It would be too great a digression in a book on domestic 
architecture to attempt to discuss the question why certain 
lines are more beautiful than others. One theory is, that 
beauty in objects depends on their power of suggesting 
pleasing associations. And it is true that these may so 
warp our judgment as to give such objects a beauty in our 
eyes which they do not in themselves possess. But it will 
not account for new objects, with which we have no such 
associations, appearing beautiful. 

The theory is rather that objects are beautiful because 
they suggest pleasing associations from some sort of resem- 
blance to them — that a colour, for instance, is beautiful 
because it recalls tenderness or purity, or a line because it 
suggests strength or grace. 

Association of this kind affects our perception of beauty 
more subtly and powerfully than accidental contiguity, 
sometimes by making us think things beautiful, but still 
oftener by suggesting something unpleasing or ludicrous, 
and so preventing us seeing beauty where it exists. Beauty 
is something distinct from pleasing associations, and we 
seem to have as good evidence of its independent existence 
as of those pleasing associations which are supposed to 
account for it, namely, our perception of it. Its essence 
may perhaps lie in the fact, that as we are a part of the 
harmonious system of nature, those objects are beautiful to 
us which are in harmony with our material and spiritual 
being. This would account for the variety of opinions as 
to beauty held by different nations, and for the basis of 


--page 33

essential agreement among them all, which is shown by the 
fact that, by entering into the feelings of their producers, we 
may come to understand and admire various and apparently 
opposite productions in art.{^1} It is not a valid objection 
that some men cannot see beauty in things undoubtedly 
beautiful. That is a defect of their nature, like the want of 
a musical ear. The poet and painter, by their sympathy 
with it, perceive beauty in nature which others do not, 
and become its interpreters to these by means of human 
sympathy. 

No theory of beauty, however, can assist us in deciding 
what things are or are not beautiful. For this we must 
have "taste," an organisation which is affected by beauty or 
ugliness, as the palate is by sweetness or bitterness. 

To produce beautiful things something more is needed 
— that creative faculty to which new combinations, new 
ideas of grandeur and beauty come unsought, which in old 
times was believed to be the inspiration of the Deity. 

To the greatest architecture the idea of Size is essential. 
Its glory is, that it creates its forms on the scale of Nature's 
grandeur. To draw a line of three or four hundred feet 
against the sky, exquisitely modelled along its whole length, 
is an achievement which raises our opinion of humanity. 
Cities are always proud of their spires. St. Paul's, or one 
of the great French cathedrals, makes the same impression 
on the mind as a great mountain. 

A characteristic of the best architecture, and one which 
art of every kind must have in some form or other, is 
Delicacy — not the mere avoidance of all coarseness and 
vulgarity, but the presence of some kind of refinement — in 
form, in colour, or in modulation of shadow. It is for this 

{^1} Mr. Darwin is of opinion that the taste of animals in regard to beauty is 
substantially the same as in mankind. 


--page 34

reason that those who have a little knowledge of an art are 
such bad judges of it. Coarse, obvious effects strike them : 
they do not see the highest, which are always hidden, like 
the violet, and have to be sought. 

The main element, however, of architectal excellence is 
Proportion. It is difficult to say wherein it consists — as 
difficult as to say what beauty is, of which, indeed, it is one 
of the elements. No rule can be laid down for it, for it is 
of many kinds — tall or low, sturdy or delicate. People have 
sometimes amused themselves calculating proportions by 
mathematics, which undoubtedly has the power of expressing 
them, but only after the proportion has been invented, just 
as mathematics can express musical harmonies. But it 
would be as possible to design architecture by mathematics 
as to compose tunes. A musical ear in the one case, an eye 
for proportion in the other, are the only tests of right. The 
faculty of expressing ideas by notes harmoniously arranged, 
of throwing words into harmonious verse, or grouping the 
parts of a building in order and proportion, is the only 
means of production in music or poetry or architecture. 

The chief sphere in which proportion finds expression in 
architecture is in the relation of solids to voids — of the 
supported parts to their supports. It does not look at the 
problem involved merely from a constructive or engineering 
point of view, asking, Will the building stand ? but, Does it 
stand with ease and grace? The building must not only 
be secure, it must look secure. To attain this result, 
a strength beyond mere constructive exigencies is often 
required. A massive stone building should not stand 
on a glass case, even when there are thin iron pillars 
behind the glass, concealed by haberdashery, quite sufficient 
to support it. The strength should be visibly ample. 
But neither ought the supports to be too strong for their 
work : a Doric column carrying only a statue, instead of 


--page 35

--figure 4. Houses at Münster, showing vertical and horizontal division of their surfaces.


--page 37

its mass of entablature, is a disproportionate waste of 
energy. 

But although resistance to gravitation is the chief motive 
of proportion in architecture, it should equally govern 
every space and form of a building — the size and shapes of 
the windows, and of the window-panes ; the amount of light 
and shadow ; the ornaments and enrichments, not only in 
their quantity, but in the mutual relations of their parts. 
A common means of attaining it is by lines or mouldings 
dividing the surface of a building into spaces, and giving 
emphasis where it is wanted. 

Such lines when drawn horizontally are called {_string 
courses_}. They originally were flat beds of solid stone going 
through the whole thickness of a wall composed of rough 
irregular materials, so as to strengthen the wall at intervals, 
usually at each floor, a level bed for the floor to rest on. 
The projecting edge was naturally ornamented with mould- 
ing or carving, and later on became a pure ornament of the 
architecture, seldom now going farther into the wall than 
the few inches necessary to fix it in its place, and I think it 
is legitimately used to give to the design the effect of hori- 
zontal division, though it does not necessarily indicate the 
precise position of the floors. Similar effects of proportion 
may be obtained by piers or pilasters dividing the building 
perpendicularly. 

Two houses at Münster (fig. 4) show this mode of 
producing architectural effect. In the farther house, to the 
left of the picture, which is late Gothic in style, the idea of 
height is more dwelt on ; the upright lines, which take the 
form of pinnacles, are kept as a fringe on the outside of the 
gable ; in the other it is rather the horizontal lines that are 
enforced. Instead of the front running up into the gable, 
it is stopped by a strong cornice. The upright lines take 
the form of Classic pilasters. 

Mr. Fergusson disapproves of the use of pilasters, and, if 


--page 38

he were Chancellor of the Exchequer, would put a pro- 
hibitory tax on them. But in every style of architecture 
effects of proportion have been obtained by enforcing the 
perpendicular or horizontal lines. The Greeks enforced the 
upright lines by fluting the columns. These bear the mass 
of entablature — the frieze and cornice, the horizontal effect 
of which is heightened by the deep projection of the 
cornice, while the sense of weight in the mass is aided by 

--figure 5.

--figure 6.

the triglyphs of the frieze, which, even if they represent 
the beam-ends of old wood construction, are now purely 
ornamental features (see fig. 20, p. 56). 

In our ordinary town houses, where we have only a front 
to deal with in which the position of the windows is fixed 
by necessity, such expedients are almost our only means of 
obtaining architectural effect. Figs. 5 to 8 illustrate some 
modes of doing this common in Classic architecture. Fig. 5 
is the most naked form of building. In fig. 6 an appearance 


--page 39

of strength is given to the angles by building them of larger 
stones. The angles of the windows are also protected and en- 
riched by a framework round them, and dignity and shadow 
is given by ornamenting the cornice and increasing its size 
and projection. But if we repeat this process through the five 
or six stories of our London houses it becomes monotonous. 

Gothic delighted in height, but the tendency of Classic 
architecture was to dwell on the horizontal line, and various 

--figure 7.

--figure 8.

expedients were resorted to to reduce the apparent height 
of the building. One was to bring down the strong line 
of the cornice, as in fig. 7, to the top of the main floor of 
the building, as if marking its importance and giving it 
dignity, and treating the rooms above as if they were only 
bedrooms, as 'an attic,' as it is called. In the old Italian 
palaces, where the great entertaining rooms were at the top 
of the house, it was fitting that the great cornice should be 
immediately over them. 



--page 40

Fig. 8 shows the common Classic mode of producing archi- 
tectural effect. The only architecture being in the orders 
derived from temples, the house is treated as a temple. The 
windows are accidents or necessary evils in the design. 
The ground floor is merely a base for a correct superstructure 
of columns and entablature. That it comprises two stories 
of the house is a regret- 
table accident which we 
must not dwell on. Yet 
noble effects have been 
gained by these means, 
and dignity and grace 
given to buildings other- 
wise dull.

Symmetry, which may 
be considered a species 
of proportion, is almost 
essential to the noblest 
buildings — at least when 
it is absent, whatever the 
other merits of the build- 
ing, the highest dignity is 
unattainable. In every 
style, Greek, Gothic, and 
Renaissance, symmetry 
controlled the designs of 
temples and churches. 

In dwelling - houses, 
though often ruling the design as in this instance (fig. 9), 
it frequently gave way to the necessities of domestic 
convenience. It means that the parts on either side 
should be balanced and similar, not necessarily identical, 
like the two spires at the end of a modern church, 
both executed from the same drawing; but similar, like 


--page 41

those of an old cathedral, each retaining its own individu- 
ality. Of late years symmetry has not been much in 
favour. In the last century it was a universally acknow- 
ledged principle. That the door should not be in the 
centre was inconceivable. If the kitchens formed one 
wing the stables had exactly to match them in the other. 
The summer-house at one side of the garden had its 
duplicate on the other, even if it was half a mile off. 
Perhaps the Scotch gardener carried the principle too far, 
who shut up his son in one 
summer-house to balance a boy 
whom he had locked up in the 
other for stealing apples. Now- 
adays, we carry the opposite 
principle to an extreme. We 
put a spire at the side of a 
church rather than in the 
centre ; and where a door comes 
naturally in the middle of the 
house, we run up a gable on 
one side only to destroy the 
symmetry, under the delusion 
that we are carrying out Gothic 
principles.

It appears from this catalogue of the artistic effects 
which architecture is capable of producing, that they 
are widely various in kind, and that many of them are 
incompatible with others. Now, for the perfection of 
any work of art, Harmony is essential. All its various 
parts should suit one another. Nothing should be out 
of keeping. Ladies appreciate this principle in dress ; it 
would be absurd to wear a brilliant bonnet with a rough 
stuff gown. It is so much the essence of music that the 
word is used as a name for it, and it is the chief essential 


--page 42

in good colouring. And so in architecture it forbids 
discord ; there must be no jarring, no part too rich or 
refined, or out of keeping with the rest. To strive after 
irregularity for its own sake is affectation, but when 
it arises naturally from the conditions of building, as 

in the little Scotch 
house (fig. 10, p. 41), it 
may be very pleasing. 
It is not the result of 
bap-hazard, but comes 
through a sense of 
art and grace in the 
builders, of which they 
may have been quite 
unconscious. 

--figure 11. House near the town hall, Nuremberg. 

In the design of this 
house at Nuremberg, 
(fig. ll) the architectural 
effect is obtained with- 
out any ornament, solely 
by means of proportion, 
exercised in a skilful dis- 
position of the windows 
and roof. By simply 
lowering the wall in 
the centre, we get the 
effect of a mass of roof 
flanked by two towers. 

If the wall were built 
up between these towers 
to the level of their cornices, as a London builder would 
have done, the design would be commonplace. It is irre- 
gular, but there is method in the irregularity. The neces- 
sities of internal arrangement make the towers different in 
size, but the centre of each is carried down and a feeling 


--page 43

of height given by the line of windows one above another. 
But for this, the horizontal line would have predominated, 
and there would have been no effect of towers in the 
design. 

Harmony is a universal law of Nature. In a few years 
she tones down the harshness of a new building, the rawness 
of rough scaur or broken rock with moss and lichens, into 
harmony and keeping with everything about it; and in 
architecture, even when the forms are bad and the style 
feeble, mere harmony will sometimes produce the effect of 
beauty. 

We dispense with it in our modern architecture to a 
wonderful extent ; more than any time or nation hitherto 
has done. We think nothing of putting rich stained glass 
in a bare, white plastered interior, like a jewel in a swine’s 
snout, or spotting the dingiest of cement house-fronts with 
flower-boxes made of the gaudiest coloured tiles, and making 
abortive attempts at art by furnishing our houses of common- 
place builders’ Classic with fiercely Gothic furniture. 

On the other hand, so intent are we sometimes to obtain 
harmony, that we compel all the houses in a street to be made 
from the same design so that a man cannot tell his own 
except from the number on the door. In our restorations of 
old buildings it has been carried so far that immense quanti- 
ties of valuable art have been removed from our churches 
and destroyed as not of the same date as the rest of the 
building, in forgetfulness of the fact that these are historical 
monuments — that their interest lies in each generation 
having left its mark on them — that the impression of wealth 
and magnificence, and contrast also, produced by the rich 
Jacobean carvings so ruthlessly removed, are valuable effects 
in architecture, as well as harmony. Harmony consists 
rather in identity of feeling than of form or style. The 
quaint old Classic screens and tombs, the grace of Inigo 
Jones, and the elaborate richness of Grinling Gibbons, are
