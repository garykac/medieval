PEE FACE. 



I BEGAN this book ten years ago during an interval in the 
practice of my profession. Many causes have delayed its 
completion, foremost among which was a sense of the 
inadequacy and imperfection of what I had written. The 
constant engagements of an architect made it difficult for 
me to give to the book the time needed to make it satis- 
factory. At the same time I was unwilling to lose the 
labour and the cost already expended. A consequence of 
the time the writing of the book has occupied is that many 
of the views it advocates, which were unusual when they 
were written, are now current and fashionable. I believe 
that the book may still be useful. Though inadequate, it 
is not, I hope, misleading. Throughout it, while stating 
my own opinions, I have tried to give the reader data for 
judging for himself. 

The illustrations have been one cause of the delay in 
publishing. They are all from wood blocks, which give 
more satisfactory results than some modern processes, not 
being liable to the imperfect printing of the lines in parts 
which is apt to occur in these. Most of the illustrations 
have been drawn on the wood by Mr. H. W. Brewer, some 
from my own sketches, but the greater part from his. The 
illustration of the Colosseum at Eome was drawn on the 
wood for me by Mr. Mac Whirter, A.R.A. 

The drawings have been cut on the wood by several 
engravers, including Mr. Cooper, Mr. Walmsley, Mr. 
Morison, Miss MacLaren, and Mr. Pitt, Miss Bateman, and

vi PREFACE. 

some others on the staff of the c Graphic,' to all of whom I 
feel under obligation for the careful way in which the cuts 
have been executed. I venture to think that some of them 
deserve a high place among modern examples of the art of 
wood engraving. 

I am indebted for the use of a number of the cuts to the 
kindness of the Proprietors of the ' Graphic/ to Mr. George 
Godwin of the ' Builder,' and to Mr. James Parker of Oxford 
for those from his father's work on ' English Domestic 
Architecture in the Middle Ages/ and the examples of the 
Orders from Bickman's * Gothic Architecture.' In two 
or three cases where the same cut illustrates different 
parts of the text, I have repeated it to save the reader the 
trouble of looking it up in a different part of the book.

December, 1879.

HOUSE ARCHITECTURE, 



CHAPTER I, 



INTRODUCTORY. 



TO build a house for oneself is an excellent education 
in architecture. By the time it is finished, and the 
owner has lived in it, he feels how much better a house 
he, could build with the experience he has acquired, if he 
had to do it over again. While the work is going on his 
attention is called to questions he had never thought of 
before, which are now of the greatest interest to him. He 
examines the houses of his friends, and discovers features 
in them which he wishes, when too late, he had introduced 
in his own plans. The designs are altered and the cost 
increased. His taste in architecture, and his ideas about 
planning are changed by his new experience ; the building 
is too far advanced to adopt the improvements, and the 
house which he had hoped would be perfect, is a source of 
trouble and disappointment. 

He could build another house to his mind, but to go 
through the experience once in a lifetime is enough for 
most people. 

VOL. i. B 



2 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

To have, before commencing the building of a new 
house, the knowledge which the experience of building 
gives in some imperfect and fragmentary way at the end of 
the process, would save the owner trouble, expense, and 
after-regret. To attempt to supply this is the object of 
this book. 

I do not imagine that any information I can give can 
supersede the services of an architect. It can no more do 
this than a treatise on medicine enables us to do without 
a doctor. Book knowledge is useless in practice without the 
tact, gained only by experience, when and how to apply it. 
But architects have frequently told me that they wished 
they had such a book as this which they could put 
into the hands of their employers; as one of their great 
difficulties is, that those for whom they are working do 
not understand what is meant by the plans, and after they 
are executed find out that the result is not what they 
wanted. If the employer could have understood what 
was proposed, and the results which were possible, mis- 
understanding and disappointment would frequently have 
been avoided. 

I shall try to treat of all matters connected with the 
building of a house, so that any one may understand them 
and have grounds for forming his own opinion. This will 
involve the discussion of questions interesting to numbers 
who have no intention of ever building a house. It 
will necessitate, as one important branch of investigation, 
an account of Architecture ; some inquiry as to its meaning 
and aims, the principles on which its rules are founded, 
and its uses. To attempt to discuss these questions would 
be useless without some brief statement of the effects which 
Architecture has aimed at, and has succeeded in producing 
in various countries. 

"We must inquire into the conditions, social and intellec- 
tual, under which Architecture produced its triumphs, and 



INTRODUCTORY. 3 

whether we may hope for satisfactory results, under the 
conditions under which we work at the present time. 

A question which must be settled before commencing a 
house, is the style of architecture it is to be built in. Till 
about fifty years ago, this question did not arise ; there was 
only one style in which people could build, that prevalent 
at the time. Since the modern Gothic revival, architects 
and all who care for Architecture have been divided as to 
whether we should adopt Gothic for our houses, or the 
Classic style, which before that revival had been universally 
used. Possibly neither of them may be quite suitable for 
us. The question cannot be satisfactorily decided without 
examining all the styles which we might reasonably employ 
with a view to our modern wants and necessities. 

Apart from its practical use, such a discussion is interest- 
ing, on its own account, to all who care for Architecture ; 
and even those who think the subject technical and dull 
may find that it is of genuine human interest. The old 
styles of Architecture were the natural outcome of the 
character and history of the nations who invented them, 
and are among the most reliable and interesting records of 
their social condition and modes of thought. Each of them 
was formed by a gradual process of development, which it is 
most interesting to trace. Architecture has of late years 
become a subject of interest, and every one feels he should 
know something of it. Truer and more practical knowledge 
of it, more widely diffused, might give us again houses 
characterised by good taste and beauty, like those of former 
times, in place of the dulness and vulgar pretentiousness 
which disfigure our streets and landscapes. 

The second volume treats of the planning and arrange- 
ment of houses, building materials, and the conveniences 
and mechanical contrivances which our modern notions of 
comfort demand. To get a perfectly satisfactory plan is of

all matters the most important in building a house. House- 
planning is an art derived through long tradition, and, 
to understand it, we must trace its history, which is full 
of interest, for it is the history of home life and social 
habits. 

To plan rightly we must know what experience has 
shown to be requisite in modern house-planning. 

Before we can combine the various rooms and offices 
together into one house, we must understand the purpose 
of each, and the best form and size for that purpose. The 
family living-rooms, the servants' offices, and the passages 
and stairs connecting them, will each form the subject of a 
chapter, before treating of the best ways of arranging and 
combining these together. 

There is a short chapter on the number of stories and 
height of houses in different circumstances, and another on 
the usual plan of town houses. 

To attempt a technical treatise on building materials 
and construction would be impossible in our space, and 
useless for our purpose ; but some information is necessary 
on the kind of materials we can have at our command, 
and the right way of using them, so as to produce a good 
architectural effect in form and colour. 

When the house is built it must be warmed and 
ventilated, supplied with water, a system of drainage, and 
various mechanical contrivances, such as bells, speak- 
ing tubes, and lifts, for convenience or to save servants' 
labour. These matters will form the subject of a chapter. 

As a house is not complete internally without decoration 
and furniture, nor externally, without its surrounding 
terraces, gardens and pleasure grounds, a complete treatise 
on house architecture ought to include chapters on these 
subjects. They were in part written, but the preparation 
of proper illustrations would have still farther postponed 
this publication, already too long delayed. 



INTRODUCTORY. 5 

These questions will be better discussed with reference 
to a house in the country, where there is some space and 
freedom of arrangement, than if we are bound by the 
stereotyped arrangements of town houses. 

Every one of them has of late years been a subject of 
interest and discussion ; and information is to be got with 
regard to all of them in magazine articles, and in books 
large and small. The literature of the subject is too 
extensive for easy acquirement or handy reference, and to 
be of practical use to any one building a house, it requires 
to be digested, and the conflicting views which abound 
on every point stated and compared. For any one without 
practical experience of building operations this process 
would be difficult, and the results probably wrong. Some 
notice of the more important works on these subjects will 
indicate the gap which this book is intended to fill. 

Mr. Euskin, in his ' Seven Lamps of Architecture/ and 
in his ' Stones of Venice/ has discussed with eloquence 
and insight the fundamental principles of Architecture, the 
value of the art to us, and the style we ought to adopt for 
modern use. By these and other writings he has inspired 
his generation with enthusiasm for art, and for nobleness 
and beauty in architecture. I do not know how far he 
holds to the views expressed in these works, as since their 
publication he has modified some of his opinions. In them 
the subject is treated too often from the point of view of 
Italy to be practically useful or true of England. I think 
some of his views on architecture are open to question, and 
that their practical influence on modern architecture has to 
some extent been mischievous. 

Mr. Fergusson, in his ' History of Architecture,' gives a 
clear and interesting account of all the great styles of 
architecture which have existed in the world. His 
three volumes form a complete text-book of great 



6 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

value. He describes the historical buildings of each style, 
especially those which are landmarks in the history of 
art, and criticises them with ability and knowledge, and 
with the confidence which springs from the consciousness 
of their possession; pointing out faults, and suggesting 
how the architect should have made his design so as to 
avoid them. 

I do not think he is always successful, but the task he 
sets himself is difficult. We do not require a critic when 
he finds fault with a poem to put it right by composing 
passages to replace those he objects to. 

It is, perhaps, a task beyond human ability to re-design 
the great buildings of the different styles of architecture, 
for it implies greater insight and architectural invention 
than their architects possessed. Trying to work out in 
several instances the results of Mr. Fergusson's proposed 
improvements on historical buildings, I have found either 
that they altered the intention of the design, or introducd 
some new difficulty which it is not unreasonable to 
suppose the designer had appreciated and avoided. In 
criticism it is at least safer, and perhaps more instructive, 
instead of suggesting alterations, to take the buildings as 
they are, and try to realise their meaning and the impres- 
sion they were intended to produce. 

Throughout the work, Mr. Fergusson contrasts the con- 
ditions under which these old styles grew up with our 
modern method of producing architecture, which he insists 
we must abandon and return to the old, if the art is to 
flourish. This question is of interest to all who care for 
architecture, and especially to architects, as it involves their 
existence. 

About twenty years ago, Sir Gilbert Scott published a 
little book on ' Secular and Domestic Architecture, Present 
and Future.' to show how suitable the Gothic style of 



INTRODUCTORY. 7 

architecture is for our houses and public buildings. Since 
then the principles he advocated have largely influenced 
our architecture, and have been adopted even by our 
ordinary builders, but the result has not been all that could 
be wished. 

Difficulties not anticipated have shown themselves in 
adapting the style to modern use, and there is a feeling that 
the question whether Gothic is the most suitable style of 
architecture for modern domestic use needs reconsideration. 

Since Sir Gilbert Scott's lamented death his lectures 
to the students of the Royal Academy, which lie had 
previously prepared for publication, have been published in 
two volumes full of admirable illustrations of English 
mediaeval ecclesiastical architecture. The lectures, which 
were delivered at intervals during fourteen years, are not 
a consecutive treatise. They give the results of the author's 
life-long enthusiastic study of mediaeval church architecture, 
especially in England. His knowledge of buildings, from 
cathedrals to village churches, was unsurpassed, and it is 
used in discussing the interesting questions of the develop- 
ment and principles of Gothic architecture. These form 
a small part of the subject of this book, which would 
be incomplete without a reference to Sir Gilbert Scott's 
views. 

In his pleasant book, i Hints on Household Taste/ 
Mr. Eastlake expresses his conviction that the " Gothic 
Renaissance" is a reformation slowly but surely taking 
place in this country, and urges the adoption of Gothic for 
our houses and for our furniture, even in ordinary Classic 
houses. His own designs in the book for decoration and 
furniture are in the Gothic style, but in the illustrations 
from old work, he shows an incipient liking for the more 
picturesque forms of the Classic style, which, I have reason 
to believe time has not diminished. 



8 HOUSE AKCHITKCTURE. 

For the history of domestic architecture in England in 
the Middle Ages, the work commenced by Mr. Hudson 
Turner, and continued by Mr. Parker, is exhaustive. I 
have availed myself largely of it in giving the history of 
house-planning, and by Mr. J. Parker's kindness I have 
been allowed the use of several of the woodcuts for these 
volumes. 

There are three systems of arrangement of the matter of 
the book by subjects, by centuries, and by counties, so that 
parts of the same subject turn up at wide intervals it is 
difficult to remember where. It is really a collection of 
valuable notes of interesting facts of mediaeval life in all 
its phases, and a copious index gets over the difficulty of 
arrangement. 

On the subject of the planning of houses, * The English 
Gentleman's House ' by Professor Kerr, contains about all 
that need be known. The book is large and would bear 
condensation. In the chapters on planning I have endea- 
voured to go over the same ground. I shall have occasion 
sometimes to refer to it, as I cannot always agree with 
the statements and recommendations contained in it. Mr. 
Kerr devotes a small portion of it to the subject of archi- 
tectural style. He suggests as the answer of the English 
gentleman, when his architect asks him in what style he 
wishes his house built? "In no style at all, except the 
comfortable style if there be one," and, "Take me as I 
am, and build my house in my own style." He gives, 
however, as samples for the gentleman to choose from, the 
same plan done up in ten different styles Elizabethan, 
and revived Elizabethan, Palladian, rural Italian, Palatial 
Italian, and French Italian, the English Renaissance style, 
the Mediaeval or Gothic style, the Cottage style, and the 
Scotch Baronial style. 

The feat is a difficult one; something like translating 



INTRODUCTORY. 9 

a piece of poetry into ten different languages. Mr. Kerr's 
designs fail in giving the nicer characteristics of the 
various styles, but this would have been too much to 
expect from one author. They have all a family likeness, 
due no doubt to their common parentage. They remind 
me of a fish dinner at which, cod, skate, and haddock 
all tasted the same, having been all cooked with the same 
lard. 

Sir Edmund Beckett has given the public the benefit of 
some of his extensive experience as a builder and amateur 
architect, in a little book which he calls, ' A Book on Build- 
ing,' in which his aim is to give practical information to 
those intending to build, how to avoid legal and structural 
mistakes. The subject of house-building occupies a con- 
siderable part of it, not treated in a systematic way, but by 
instances of the mistakes which, in his experience, builders 
and architects are liable to commit. The book does not 
profess to be a systematic treatise, and assumes the necessity 
of architects. The arrangement is somewhat heteroge- 
neous ; such diverse subjects as kitchen grates, skylights, 
oak graining (which the author approves of ), and windows 
all being treated of together. It goes into minute detail on 
some points, but I doubt if the information and directions 
are sufficient to enable an employer, who had not the 
practical experience of the author, to keep from error an 
architect who did not know his business. It leaves a 
strong impression of the risk which any one runs in build- 
ing, unless he superintends his architect not only in making 
the plans, but in carrying out the work. 

The first chapter treats of agreements with architects and 
builders, giving model forms of contract, to prevent the 
employer surrendering his authority over the work, and 
controverts the doctrine which, it seems, is held by some 
architects that, " after the plans are settled and the work 



10 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

commenced, the * client ' must yield himself absolutely to his 
professional adviser." It is reasonable rather that as he 
pays his money he should have his choice. Employers 
may sometimes insist on things in a building which an 
architect could not carry out consistently with his own 
credit. But it is seldom that the employer's wishes, 
though they may not be what the architect thinks best, 
cannot be worked into the design. 

One plan of a house is given, which Sir Edmund Beckett 
designed for himself. It has a central hall lighted from 
the ceiling and contains many of the usual modern arrange- 
ments, but the want of facility in getting over difficulties, 
not uncommon in the work of amateurs, may be detected 
in parts, and a single instance is in any case insufficient 
to give an adequate idea of house-planning. 

The views expressed by the author are always decided, 
and many of them are the same as my own experience had 
led me to form* In judging of the architectural merit of 
buildings he takes, as we must all do, his own taste as 
the standard, with too little appreciation, perhaps, of the 
possibility of a different opinion in others. 

The book also contains chapters on the theory of domes 
and on the great pyramid. 

The late M. Yiollet-le-Duc, the author of the admirable 
1 Dictionary of French Mediaeval Architecture,' recently pub- 
lished a charming little book, which has been translated into 
English, under the title of ' How to Build a House.' The 
title is somewhat deceptive ; the French title, ' L'Histoire 
d'une Maison,' describes the contents more accurately. 

It would not help any one in building an English house. 
The conditions of building are those of French country parts, 
where the materials and modes of work differ from ours in 
England. The plan is eminently French; no isolation of 



INTRODUCTORY. 11 

the public rooms, but all opening one into another, the 
bedrooms sufficient only for the limited size of French 
families ; the whole nursery accommodation in a house 
which costs 6000 being a small bedroom over the kitchen. 

The book, in plan a novelette, is a pleasantly told lesson 
on the principles of common-sense architecture. A lad, idle 
at home during the German war, is set, under the guidance 
of his cousin, an architect, to build a house as a surprise for 
his sister on her return from her marriage jaunt. Knowing 
architecture only from the treatises on the five orders 
in his father's library, he had thought it a dreary subject, 
but his interest is awakened by being taught by practical 
experience how every feature of architecture springs from 
use and convenience. It is not shown, however, how 

&gt;inted arches, and some other features introduced into the 
lesign of the house, spring from any necessity of construc- 
ion or use. The book is an excellent one for creating an 
interest in the subject. 

The same author had recently published another book 
also translated into English, under the title of ( The Habi- 
tations of Man in All Ages/ also in form a novelette. Two 
" beings " with an interest in house building visit, after the 
manner of the Wandering Jew, the various countries of the 
world, beginning with the times of the cave men, and 
taking leave of us at a dinner at a Paris restaurant in the 
days of the Second Empire. One of the companions is con- 
servative, the other in favour of the successive improve- 
ments in the construction of dwellings which they come 
across in their large experience. Both are rather bores, 
while the descriptions and pictures of the houses they see 
are, like- the celebrated treatise of the author's countryman 
on the camel, drawn largely from his own imagination. 
The addition of the data, if any, on which they are founded, 
would have made the book of more value. It does not 
profess to treat of modern houses. 



12 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

M. Viollet-le-Duc's ' Dictionary of Gothic Architecture ' is 
well known in this country, where the greater favour for 
this style has made it more popular than in France. 

It is a complete encyclopaedia of French mediaeval archi- 
tecture, containing admirable treatises on its principles and 
history, and on the arts connected with it; every detail 
being explained and illustrated with a wealth of knowledge, 
which seems to include every example of the style. I have 
been largely indebted to it for a knowledge of Gothic archi- 
tecture in its history, its principles, and its forms. The 
illustrations are very clever, well drawn and well cut on the 
wood. In their style, clean and sharp and rather thin, they 
suggest modern Gothic, and they somehow impart an air 
of modern Gothic to all the buildings, even the Classic ones, 
which they illustrate. The pointing of the stones is always 
carefully shown, which gives an air of surface and reality to 
the drawings. 

It is possibly on account of its success in the drawings 
that M. Yiollet-le-Duc has occasionally in his restorations 
applied the same process to the buildings themselves, by 
filling in the joints of the stones with black mortar, making 
the interior a net-work of black lines. This is not what the 
old builders intended. In the desire to show the construc- 
tion the architecture is lost. M. Yiollet-le-Duc was more 
successful as an author than as an architect. 

Information on all the subjects I purpose to treat can be 
found in the Cyclopaedias and Dictionaries of Architecture, 
such as Gwilt's &lt; Encyclopaedia/ or Raynaud's 'Traite d' Archi- 
tecture/ Paris 1863. The former, even in its later editions, 
is somewhat out of date in its information and its views. 
The short chapter on house-planning takes as a standard 
houses about a century old in its criticism of buildings it 
judges of their merits according to their Classic purity. 

Raynaud's book is more modern and thorough, but it is 



INTRODUCTORY. 13 

based on French practice, and is an unsafe guide for English 
methods of work. Such books are of more use as books 
of reference to the profession than for teaching beginners, 
for which purpose an alphabetical' arrangement is un- 
satisfactory. 

On the important subjects of draining, ventilation, 
heating, &amp;c., many treatises have lately been published, 
advocating different systems, and inventions are constantly 
advertised, which it would be tedious to enumerate. I have 
attempted to explain the principles of systems which have 
proved successful in practice. 

There is justification, I think, for a book which aims to 
collect together all that need be said on these subjects, for 
ordinary practical purposes. On each of them books have 
been written, but what is essential to be known may, I 
think, be given within a few chapters. 

As I do not presume to teach the profession, but only the 
unlearned, I shall try to avoid technical terms, taking 
nothing for granted, but deducing everything from common 
first principles. 

In former days, when the old styles of architecture 
flourished, there was no occasion for such investigation of 
the principles and practice of these arts, for each age had 
only one way of working in them ; all others being either 
inconceivable or false. The only difference consisted in 
doing better or worse the same things in the same way ; 
and the changes of style were so gradual, like those of 
natural growth, that though obvious when measured over 
centuries, they were unnoticed as they occurred. 

We have cut ourselves loose from tradition. Instead of 
accepting and trustfully following the ways and customs 
handed down to us, we claim to be absolute judges of right, 
and make our individual preferences laws. It would need 



14 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

omniscience not to fail. It may be some explanation of 
this state of matters with regard to architecture, that since 
the Middle Ages closed, the same uncertainty has prevailed 
in other matters. In religion, philosophy, politics, even 
in morals, as well as in architecture, it seems as if the 
grounds of our faith had to be settled anew. We cannot, 
as of old, trust the experts, for they are not themselves 
agreed. The thread of tradition has been cut, and in these, 
as in architecture, there are now no authoritative standards 
or articles of faith to which appeal can be made, and 
judgment given. 

Some may be content in building to accept at hap- 
hazard the first advice that turns up ; but to form rational 
decisions, and to have an intelligent interest in the work, a 
man must understand the principles of the arts which find a 
place in it, especially of architecture in its double purpose 
of ministering to convenience and beauty. He must know 
its aims, and wherein its goodness consists the causes of 
present failure, and the conditions necessary for success 
and 'something of the nature and merits of different styles, 
if he has to decide which is best to choose. 

Till the public care more for it, and know more about it, 
we cannot look for much improvement. Why should they 
spend money, and put themselves to trouble for mere dis- 
play or to gratify whims of architects, which they neither 
appreciate nor understand ? Better take the builder's house 
with its compo-dressings and vulgar ornament. It is 
sensibly planned and seems cheap at the money. But it 
has been built to sell. The principle of construction seems 
to be that it shall be always out of repair, so as to 
provide constant work for the building trades; and that 
at the end of the lease it may be worthless to the ground 
landlord. 

The walls are thin and let in the cold and the sound even 
of conversation from the next house. But for the floor 



INTRODUCTORY. 15 

timbers which tie them together, a gust of wind would 
overturn them ; the floors shake with the slightest move- 
ment; the plaster is half sand, and is kept on the walls 
mainly by the paper pasted on it ; doors and windows do 
not fit ; the plumber work is bad ; the smell and poison 
of the drains come in, and the water-pipes freeze ; the 
"compo" outside, imitating massive stonework, requires 
constant painting, and occasionally scales off in masses. 
Its existence is a constant process of going to pieces ; work- 
men are never out of it, and the tenant finds that to keep 
it habitable adds a third to his rent. The architecture, 
however small the house may be, is a union of vulgar 
pretentiousness and mean shams. 

The houses which men build for themselves need not 
have these faults of bad workmanship, but they are some- 
times ill planned and often ugly. The owner may have had 
every desire to make his house a charming residence, and 
have spent money ungrudgingly, but too often his hopes are 
not fulfilled. It is not perfect as he intended. If he had to 
do it over again, he would make it different. He finds, 
perhaps, that he has miscalculated his requirements, and the 
destination of the rooms has to be changed, destroying the 
cherished arrangements of the plan ; or in his desire for 
light and view, he has made his drawing-room all window 
scorching in summer, cold in winter, and without wall space 
for the furniture ; or possibly, notwithstanding every care, 
the damp comes through the walls, some of the chimneys 
smoke, or the water-pipes freeze. Frequently he finds that 
while it was being built his taste has changed. With better 
knowledge, from the attention he has given to the matter 
since he became practically interested in building, he now 
sees how much better his house might have been ; that what 
he thought would be beautiful and grand is fantastic, or 
vulgar and pretentious ; or, if he does not see it, it may be 
none the less true. From whatever cause it arises, it is 



16 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

generally admitted that a large proportion of modern houses 
are architectural failures. 

The art in them, such as it is, usually stops at the outside. 
Here they may have some resemblance to a mediaeval castle 
or an Italian palace, but we know that on entering we shall 
find neither the bold stone carving ihe construction every- 
where apparent the tapestry, and stained glass of the one^ 
nor the marbles and frescoes of the other. Whether Classic 
or Grothic, the lobby will be painted in imitation of marble 
or granite; the dining-room with a plain tint of light 
green, and a whitewashed ceiling ; the drawing-room paper 
of the last fashionable pattern ; the bedrooms as common- 
place as those of an hotel ; the carpets attempting to look 
an uneven surface of holes we would stumble in, and 
bunches of flowers we would crush in walking over ; the 
furniture a mass of unmeaning curves ; the pictures mere 
furniture, and no part of the architecture. In both there 
are the same gigantic mirrors, and great plate-glass 
windows with muslin curtains, occasionally, perhaps, a 
few old buffets or carved chairs from Wardour Street 
reminiscences of the time when the same art and style 
governed not only the outside architecture of the house, but 
its internal decorations and everything it contained. 

In old times it was not so. A man was certain in 
building to get his money's worth in art. Every old house 
is interesting, not because it is old, but because it is good. 
The style of one age may be better than another, but all are 
good in their way. The houses of Pompeii were all works 
of art ; so are the few remains of Komanesque domestic 
architecture, at Cluny and elsewhere. Old Gothic houses 
of every period of the style are beautiful. Our streets are 
not to be compared in beauty with those of Venice, even in 
their decay, with all their colour gone, or in picturesqueness 
with those of Nuremberg (frontispiece), which was no better 
than many another city of its day, but has had the good 



INTRODUCTORY. 17 

fortune to have been preserved till now from modern altera- 
tions. For the charm of homeliness nothing can surpass 
the houses of the Tudor age, with their mullioned windows 
and oak-carving ; and we can only feebly imitate the 
sumptuousness and elegance of those of the Renaissance of 
Francis I., or of our own Jacobean. Some may be better 
than others, but there are no failures such as we now 
constantly see produced. All are good architecture of their 
kind, not great mansions only, but farmhouses and cottages 
in village streets. And these results were accomplished, not 
by a specially educated profession, like the architects of the 
present day, directing the tradesmen by means of drawings 
and instructions, but by common tradesmen themselves, 
without any superintendence. Every village mason could 
build houses and churches such as for excellence and 
accuracy in architectural style we vainly now, with all our 
knowledge, attempt to imitate. Every village carpenter 
could make furniture more beautiful and in truer taste 
than the best town-made nowadays solid in construction, 
graceful in line, and rich in carving. 

As for house-painting, we have ceased, justly enough, 
perhaps, to consider it an art. We do not look on those 
painters as artists who work on the walls of our rooms. 
Every London builder thinks himself competent to design 
and execute decoration. Some call themselves plumbers 
and decorators, and one large London upholstering firm 
advertises that it includes decoration in its house agency 
department. Cheesemonger and decorator would be about 
as congruous. We prefer to give artistic work to " prac- 
tical men," as they are called, that is, to those who know 
nothing about the subject. 

In old time people thought great artists were the proper

tural proportions, and good colour, the artistic expression 
of their purpose and of modern life, not of uses and habits 
long extinct, but they must have the same qualities, the 
same art, inside, in all their decorations and furnishing. 
We copy only one part, and that the least important in 
the general effect of former systems of architecture the 
stone mouldings and ornaments which time happens to have 
left to us omitting the decoration, and making the furniture 
discordant, because in the buildings we copy from the one 
happens to have perished and the other to be removed. 

To be really a high work of art, a house must not only 
be beautiful outside, and all its surroundings in harmony, 
but inside there must be not only no shams and meannesses, 
but good art throughout ; the walls and ceilings rich in 
colour and in art expression ; paintings as good as art 
can make them, their decoration a part of them not 
hung on them by strings ; the sculpture only the decora- 
tion of the architecture, the crowning points of its ornament 
or the enrichment of its surface, and in thus aiding it, 
acquiring an interest it never has when thinking only 
of itself; the furniture good in construction, graceful in 
its lines, and in harmony with the architecture ; all the 
resources of art and manufacture, carpets, rich hangings, 
stained glass, gilding, carving, painting, good as art, and 
ministering to one harmonious effect. 

The thing has been. The houses of Pompeii were 
second-rate performances in their age, but for wealth of art 
throughout them, and unity of design down to the smallest 
details, our richest mansions cannot compare with them. 

A few battered buildings pulled about and altered, their 
furniture removed long since, when their old owners left 
them, a scrap of colour here and there on the walls, telling 
that they once glowed with it, are all that remains to us of 
the houses of the Middle Ages. 

But in their churches we can still trace the evidence of 



INTRODUCTORY. 19 

what architecture then meant. Their windows here and 
there, as at York, or Bourges, or Chartres, still show us a 
splendour of colour in their stained glass which, but for 
them, w r e should never have dreamt of; the marble pillars 
remain ; in places the floor, after the treading of forty 
generations, still glows with rich patterns of coloured tiles, 
and, under accumulated coats of whitewash, every now and 
then we discover traces of the painting which once covered 
their walls, was concentrated in brightness on the tombs 
and altars, and culminated on the ceiling ; great crowns 
suspended from the roofs, studded with jewels and sparkling 
with lights ; vestments, hangings, and furniture, admirable 
in. colour and design, all uniting in producing an effect of 
rich, glowing splendour, of which these churches now are 
but the grey, white skeletons. The tiled floors and stained 
glass remain, for the colour in them was in imperishable 
material ; but they are only isolated scraps of a system of 
decoration which pervaded the whole building. Floors 
and windows are the last parts of a room we should think 
of colouring. The object in using encaustic tiles and 
stained glass was merely to carry out over windows and 
floors the colouring of the other parts of the building ; and 
we think we are reviving mediaeval art when we copy these 
only, and leave the walls and ceiling cold stone, or raw, 
grey plaster. 

It is of some interest to investigate the reasons why art 
in our houses is so hopeless and helpless, so often mere 
failure, and its greatest successes only bad imitations of the 
art which nations and periods inferior to us in wealth and 
resources produced constantly and naturally, and without 
apparent effort. 

It may be that the present degraded state of house-build- 
ing is inevitable ; that we must submit to see the country 
covered with miles of dismal, uninteresting streets, and 
spotted over with villas which violate good taste and

destroy its beauty, and be content with houses which make 
our lives in them a succession of annoyances ; but if a 
remedy is to be found, the first step must be to know the 
causes which have produced our failure. 

There are indications of a prevalent desire for a better 
state of things ; and a knowledge of the objects to be aimed 
at, and the results attainable, in convenience and beauty, in 
a house and its belongings, may prevent a waste of effort 
in wrong directions, along paths by which advancement is 
impossible may give higher and truer aims to those who 
are building for themselves, and, in time, might even 
improve the houses built on speculation by diffusing better 
taste, and creating a preference for houses sounder in con- 
struction and less vulgar in style. 

It is not because we are too poor that our buildings now 
cannot attempt to rival, in completeness and splendour of 
art, those of Greece or Eome, or of the Middle Ages. 
Nor is it even from our unwillingness to spend money. 
I suppose no age ever supported a greater number of 
artists, not in comfort merely, but in wealth. I certainly 
do not grudge it them, for none know better how to spend 
it. Besides those artists whom we know, who furnish the 
walls of the principal exhibitions, there is an innumerable 
company whose names we never hear, who turn out moon- 
lights, or mills, or mountain scenery with the regularity of 
manufacture, and somehow find a continuous sale. There 
are miles on miles of new pictures exhibited each year, 
which must get sold somehow, or the supply would cease. 
Sculpture, perhaps, is more a drug in the market ; though 
the number of British Philistines and others who each 
year have their features immortalised in imperishable 
marble is considerable much greater than those we see 
ranged close in rows like gallipots on shelves in exhibitions. 
And of expenditure on architecture there is certainly no 
stint. Old churches are pulled down for the mere pleasure 



INTRODUCTORY. 21 

of building new ones (more's the pity) ; new town halls, 
law courts, country houses, town mansions, clubs, churches, 
colleges, are rising everywhere in many cases the building 
motive being the desire of increased magnificence, and the 
pleasure of building, rather than the necessity ; and to this 
expenditure I object, of course, still less than to that on 
easel pictures. But are the results satisfactory ? are the 
churches as good as old ones ? Do the mansions in town 
or country approach in beauty, in completeness of art, 
those of the times of the Tudors or Stuarts ? Does the 
result in the club-houses justify the money spent on 
them ? It is not sufficient answer to point to one or two 
perfect houses or churches among the thousands built. In 
the old times there were- none bad. They may not show 
originality, or genius, or cleverness; but from palace to 
cottage they are natural and harmonious throughout, and 
yet they were no doubt built by common builders, for 
architects were not thought of, except for the most important 
works. 

There was a sense of art in the people, which did not need 
grand buildings or great expenditure for its manifestation, 
but showed itself in the cheapest and commonest structures. 
Here is a mere shed for holding ladders at a small German 
village (fig. 1, next page), which shows the old instinct, 
which we seem to have lost, to make the commonest things 
interesting and pleasing. 

Nowadays, except in rare and special instances, our 
buildings are bad and inartistic. And these special buildings 
are all imitations, more or less perfect, of old work. 

It is of little use asking who is to blame. The most 
obvious answer is, that it is the architects themselves, and 
the most obvious remedy, to hang a few of them ; but the 
answer, though simple, is only half true, and the remedy, 
though severe, would be inadequate. The evil is not so 
much ignorance of architecture on the part either of its

professors or the public, for every one with any pretensions 
to taste knows something about it, has read Buskin, and 
considers himself (or herself) a judge ; and never in the 
world's history were there so many styles understood and 
practised, more or less correctly. It may be that we know 
too much about architectural styles that the variety of our 
knowledge confuses us, and prevents us doing what would 
be natural that our restlessness prevents us sticking to 
any one of them till we have perfected it, and made it our 
own. Or our wealth, instead of helping us, may be the

cause of our failure. We may be so devoted to its acquisi- 
tion that we have no time left to learn how to spend 
it ; for money alone can no more give us art than it 
can give us learning. Or we may not really care for art 
paying for it, not that we like it, but because we think 
our position in society requires a certain amount of dis- 
play, which bad art will satisfy as well as good. Or the 
character of our buildings, as in all architectural styles, 
may merely express the character of the people who 
produce them ; the display of magnificence in coarse 



INTRODUCTORY. 23 

form and cheap material be the natural outcome of our 
vulgarity ; the attempts to make things look, not what 
they are, but like something else which is thought 
grander as a row of little houses clubbing together 
with the help of stucco ornaments so as to look like 
a palace, or a dwelling-house with a quarter of an acre 
of ground from which the owner goes up to business 
every morning, and where the newspaper is delivered 
before breakfast, frowning with battlements, and making 
believe as if it held the country round in serfdom may 
be the reflex of our pretentiousness and falsity, and signs 
that in our hearts we are ashamed of ourselves. 

No doubt all this is partly true, but not, I believe, to the 
extent which the universality almost of such qualities in 
the architecture would indicate ; for I think it can be 
shown that the conditions under which architecture works 
at present in this country give a facility and amount of 
expresssion to such qualities altogether disproportionate to 
their prevalence among the people. 

The subject has really a greater than mere dilettante 
interest. Though we may not be conscious of it, it is no 
slight evil that the houses in which the greatest portion of 
the people live are built independently of art at all, or in 
defiance of it. Within the last twenty or thirty years 
whole towns have come into existence, which exhibit what 
seems a new characteristic in the human race namely, 
utter disregard to the beauty of their dwellings. Never, 
so far as I know, have there been collections of human 
habitations so dismal, so completely without one artistic 
quality, or consequently so inhuman, as the miles on miles 
of uniform streets in our new manufacturing towns. The 
hut of the savage is at least picturesque ; for love for the 
beautiful a desire to ornament and turn into objects of art 
the things they use has hitherto been a characteristic of 
all men, even the most degraded, 



24 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

If a town is old, however poor, it is sure to have some 
beauty or interest ; if new, we look for neither, hut get out 
of it as soon as we can. 

Those who live among this ugliness possibly feel it no 
hardship. If so, it only means that it has entered their 
souls, and that they are losing one of the characteristics of 
humanity ; and it is a question, whether the intense rest- 
lessness of modern life is not aggravated by the places we 
live in, even where art is attempted, being so devoid of any 
beauty which can give lasting satisfaction. 






CHAPTER II. 



WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ARCHITECTURE ? 



THIS question has of late years, in this country, been 
obscured and rendered almost impossible of answer 
by the rivalry of competing styles. One party would 
almost say that good Architecture is Gothic architecture, 
the other that it is Classic. But some specimens so bad in 
both styles have been perpetrated, that even their own 
friends cannot acknowledge them. 

Not only may architecture be good or bad in any style, 
but it is essentially the same qualities that render it so in 
every style. 

Architecture is simply the useful art of building elevated 
to a fine art, following the tendency which all human beings 
have to make articles of use beautiful as well. Out of the 
same instinct, in all ages, the necessity of clothing has de- 
veloped the art of dress. On the oldest pottery there is 
ornament, and carvings on bone utensils have been found 
coeval with the elk and the reindeer in France. No 
amount of decoration was thought too great in any tribe for 



26 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

their weapons, axes, clubs, and swords : what was always 
beside them they wished to be beautiful ; and when they 
became settled, they ornamented their houses from the 
same motive. But they also built houses for their gods; 
and Architecture, with religion as a motive-power, has had 
a higher and more poetic development than it could have 
had in merely ministering to human wants. 

As the art to begin with is a useful one, that a building 
should be good architecturally, the first condition is that it 
should serve its purpose houses must be suited to the wants 
and habits of their inhabitants; castles must be strong; 
churches and temples adapted to the worship or the rites 
celebrated in them. 

Again, as it is a structural art, consisting in putting 
materials together for a certain purpose, the second essential 
of good architecture is good construction disposing the 
materials in the best form for strength and stability. 

Thus far we have merely good building ; to become archi- 
tecture, which is a fine art, the element of beauty or of 
artistic expression must be added. From the first dawn 
of civilisation all building was architectural. It has been 
reserved for our age to find out that beauty in our dwell- 
ings is not worth striving for, that material wants are all 
that need be attended to. 

Yarious means have been used for arranging and treating 
buildings so as to add to them the element of art, and so 
make them architectural. Some nations covered them with 
ornament wherever they could put it. But, though this 
practice is not without advocates and examples in our day, 
it is unthinking and savage art. 

An illustration in Mr. Owen Jones's ' Grammar of Orna- 
ment,' of the tattooed face of a New Zealander, shows how 
hideous may be the results, even of ornament in itself 
beautiful, when used in the wrong place ; and the same effect 
would be produced in architecture, though not perhaps so 



WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ARCHITECTURE? 27 

strikingly, if a Doric column were covered with ornament 
instead of the flirtings which mark its purpose. 

Architecture, to attain its highest development, must have 
something more than mere ornament the intellectual 
qualities of proportion and expression. This is true of all 
arts : music is proportion in sounds ; painting is proportion 
in colour and forms ; and architecture, proportion of masses, 
of solids and voids. But to constitute true art there must 
be something more, the expression of human feeling or 
character. 

That music and painting can express these, we know ; 
but that with stones and bricks, and wood and plaster, and 
while pursuing the vulgar human need of shelter, an archi- 
tect should not only express human feelings and character 
such as power or tenderness, refinement or coarseness, 
grandeur or meanness but his own character, seems 
strange, stranger rather that he cannot help doing it. 
But to do this a power of architectural expression must be 
presupposed, just as a man must have the faculty of musical 
expression, to be a composer. So that to get good archi- 
tecture, what is wanted is a good architect, one who has 
the power to construct and arrange the masses and forms 
of a building, and by means of them to express nobleness 
or beauty. 

There are various ways of disposing building materials 
so as to produce artistic results. Mere height has been an 
object of architectural effort since the builders at Babel 
commenced their tower to reach to heaven, while more 
imposing even is the effect of length in endless ranges 
of columns and arcades. 

Mere mass of perpendicular windowless wall, even where 
there has been no conscious aim at architectural effect, is a 
most powerful one. It is mainly from this cause that old 
Scotch castles are so grand, while their modern imitations, 
riddled with windows, are so weak and feeble. 



28

But perhaps the more powerful means of producing 
grandeur is by shadow from great projecting cornices, or 
under deep porticoes, or in the dark recesses of great 
arches. 

To the most impressive architecture, mystery is essential 
the feeling that there is something more than we see. 
Glory half hid is double in effect. The half, as the Greeks 
knew, is often greater than the whole. The plays of 
' Medea ' and ' Macbeth ' prove that this is equally true in 
dramatic art. 

TRUTH is essential in good architecture, as it is in all 
art, though in architecture, as in other spheres, it may be 
impossible satisfactorily to answer the old question, " What 
is Truth ? " " Truth " generally means the correspondence 
of a representation with the facts ; and architecture, to be 
true, must be the expression of building necessities. Con- 
venience must not be sacrificed to appearance ; materials 
must show themselves to be what they really are, and 
not something different ; the construction which appears 



WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ARCHITECTURE? 29 

must be that which actually supports the building. But, in 
architecture, as in other arts, the representation must be 
artistic ; not a dull, unarranged, unmodified statement of 
facts as they happen to turn up. It is tiresome to tell 
everything, as an old woman tells her story, wearisomely 
relating whether a thing happened on a Wednesday or a 
Friday, giving genealogies and dates of marriage of all the 
persons mentioned, though these have no bearing on the 
point. The object in a work of art is to convey an impres- 
sion. To this all the parts must tend, and what is irrelevant 
must be suppressed or modified. A photograph is true 
(except that the relation of light and shadow is destroyed by 
green or red and yellow all being turned to black), but even 
if it represented Nature's colour, or her relations of light 
and shade, it would not be a work of art: it is not the 
impression on the mind of an artist expressed by him in such 
a way as to impress others ; it tells a great many things 
which no one is interested to know. So in architecture there 
is no need for painfully making every constructive expedient 
apparent, and bringing into prominence those meaner 
accessories of a dwelling-house, which, however essential, 
one does not care to refer to, or force on the attention. 
Language shows us that art is not a merely bare and true 
representation of facts, in the meanings it gives to u artless " 
as truthfully simple, and to "artful" as cunningly false. The 
border-line at which the production of artistic effect becomes 
falsehood must always be difficult to define. There may be 
ugly necessities of building construction, which it is right 
to conceal under beautiful forms or fine colour, as Nature 
conceals our bones and muscles under the rounded forms and 
marvellous flesh-colour of our bodies. As in these, so in 
architecture, the fundamental construction, though it need 
not be offensively obtruded, should be truly indicated ; and 
the greater the amount of truth in materials and construction 
that can be expressed without losing sight of the artistic 



30 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



idea at which the architecture aims, the nobler is the archi- 
tecture. That of the Romans is not satisfactory. They 
ornamented buildings, in which the main construction was 
arched, with pillars and lintels borrowed from Greek 

architecture ; and 
although great 
magnificence re- 
sulted, it was never 
satisfactory, be- 
cause it was at 
bottom untrue. 
Gothic architec- 
ture, 011 the other 
hand, was truth 
itself. Happily 
for it, no other 
better architecture 
was known which 
they might have 
been tempted to 
copy for the sake 
of its beauty, and 
whatever the ma- 
terials or construc- 
tion employed, 
they were allowed 
to tell their own 
tale. 

In the course 
of their growth 
many of the older 

architectures imitated forms in stone, which had been deve- 
loped in older wooden construction, or hewed out an archi- 
tecture in solid rock, which had grown in constructions of 
built stone (fig. 3). 




Fig. 3. 



ROCK-HEWN ARCHITECTURE, PETRA. 



WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ARCHITECTURE? 31 

Such things are interesting to trace, as illustrating the 
continuous but inconceivably slow progress of human ideas, 
but no architecture can be perfect which retains them. 
Nowadays, with the beauties of all known architectures 
available for imitation, which can seldom be natural or truth- 
ful modes of expression for us, the temptations to this form 
of falsity are almost irresistible. 

Perhaps no age has ever indulged more than our own 
in the shabbier and more vulgar form of untruthfulness, 
of attempting to make cheap, mean materials look as if they 
were rare and valuable, painting and sanding deal boards 
so that they may pass for solid stone, or graining them to 
look like oak or rare marble ; or copying in stucco the archi- 
tecture of Italian palaces, and plastering it on common 
houses. Some people seem to think that tricks and decep- 
tions are legitimate means of producing artistic effects, such 
as making a range of small houses look as if it were one 
palace, or filling in the pillared recess at the end of a room 
with a single mirror without a frame, in the hope of making 
the room look twice as large. The deception is soon found 
out and becomes ridiculous. One house gets painted which 
includes half of some architectural ornament shared with the 
next, while the rest remain dingy ; or some stranger breaks 
his nose on the mirror by attempting to walk into the 
supposed extension of the room. The people who like 
these little tricks are often honourable and truthful. Their 
morality does not lie in the sphere of art. One of the 
houestest men I know was charmed at my mistaking a 
wooden oriel window in his house which had been skilfully 
sanded over for a stone one. His honesty lay in a different 
sphere. Just as, some artists who have a zeal for their art 
as earnest as ever burnt for religion who pursue it for the 
love of it, independent altogether of profit are often careless 
about getting into debt, and regard money obligations as 
altogether secondary to doing their work honestly and well. 



32 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

In the sphere of art, truth and honesty are as essential to 
excellence as to morality ; and our only hope of freshness 
and originality in our architecture must lie in allowing it to 
express our actual necessities, with perfect naturalness arid 
truth. 

BEAUTY, though there may be good and noble architec- 
ture without it, is essential to the highest forms of the art. 
It would be too great a digression in a book on domestic 
architecture to attempt to discuss the question why certain 
lines are more beautiful than others. One theory is, that 
beauty in objects depends on their power of suggesting 
pleasing associations. And it is true that these may so 
warp our judgment as to give such objects a beauty in our 
eyes which they do not in themselves possess. But it will 
not account for new objects, with which we have no such 
associations, appearing beautiful. 

The theory is rather that objects are beautiful because 
they suggest pleasing associations from some sort of resem- 
blance to them that a colour, for instance, is beautiful 
because it recalls tenderness or purity, or a line because it 
suggests strength or grace. 

Association of this kind affects our perception of beauty 
more subtly and powerfully than accidental contiguity, 
sometimes by making us think things beautiful, but still 
oftener by suggesting something unpleasing or ludicrous, 
and so preventing us seeing beauty where it exists. Beauty 
is something distinct from pleasing associations, and we 
seem to have as good evidence of its independent existence 
as of those pleasing associations which are supposed to 
account for it, namely, our perception of it. Its essence 
may perhaps lie in the fact, that as we are a part of the 
harmonious system of nature, those objects are beautiful to 
us which are in harmony with our material and spiritual 
being. This would account for the variety of opinions as 
to beauty held by different nations, and for the basis of 



WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ARCHITECTURE? 33 

essential agreement among them all, which is shown by the 
fact that, by entering into the feelings of their producers, we 
may 'come to understand and admire various and apparently 
opposite productions in art. 1 It is not a valid objection 
that some men cannot see beauty in things undoubtedly 
beautiful. That is a defect of their nature, like the want of 
a musical ear. The poet and painter, by their sympathy 
with it, perceive beauty in nature which others do not, 
and become its interpreters to these by means of human 
sympathy. 

No theory of beauty, however, can assist us in deciding 
what things are or are not beautiful. For this we must 
have " taste," an organisation which is affected by beauty or 
ugliness, as the palate is by sweetness or bitterness. 

To produce beautiful things something more is needed 
that creative faculty to which new combinations, new 
ideas of grandeur and beauty come unsought, which in old 
times was believed to be the inspiration of the Deity. 

To the greatest architecture the idea of SIZE is essential. 
Its glory is, that it creates its forms on the scale of Nature's 
grandeur. To draw a line of three or four hundred feet 
against the sky, exquisitely modelled along its whole length, 
is an achievement which raises our opinion, of humanity. 
Cities are always proud of their spires. St. Paul's, or one 
of the great French cathedrals, makes the same impression 
on the mind as a great mountain. 

A characteristic of the best architecture, and one which 
art of every kind must have in some form or other, is 
DELICACY not the mere avoidance of all coarseness and 
vulgarity, but the presence of some kind of refinement in 
form, in colour, or in modulation of shadow. It is for this 

1 Mr. Darwin is of opinion that the taste of animals in regard to beauty is 
substantially the same as in mankind. 

VOL. I. D 



34 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

reason that those who have a little knowledge of an art are 
such bad judges of it. Coarse, obvious effects strike them : 
they do not see the highest, which are always hidden, like 
the violet, and have to be sought. 

The main element, however, of architectal excellence is 
PROPORTION. It is difficult to say wherein it consists as 
difficult as to say what beauty is, of which, indeed, it is one 
of the elements. No rule can be laid down for it, for it is 
of many kinds tall or low, sturdy or delicate. People have 
sometimes amused themselves calculating proportions by 
mathematics, which undoubtedly has the power of expressing 
them, but only after the proportion has been invented, just 
as mathematics can express musical harmonies. But it 
would be as possible to design architecture by mathematics 
as to compose tunes. A musical ear in the one case, an eye 
for proportion in the other, are the only tests of right. The 
faculty of expressing ideas by notes harmoniously arranged, 
of throwing words into harmonious verse, or grouping the 
parts of a building in order and proportion, is the only 
means of production in music or poetry or architecture. 

The chief sphere in which proportion finds expression in 
architecture is in the relation of solids to voids of the 
supported parts to their supports. It does not look at the 
problem involved merely from a constructive or engineering 
point of view, asking, Will the building stand ? but, Does it 
stand with ease and grace? The building must not only 
be secure, it must look secure. To attain this result, 
a strength beyond mere constructive exigencies is often 
required. A massive stone building should not stand 
on a glass case, even when there are thin iron pillars 
behind the glass, concealed by haberdashery, quite sufficient 
to support it. The strength should be visibly ample. 
But neither ought the supports to be too strong for their 
work : a Doric column carrying only a statue, instead of

WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ARCHITECTURE? 37 

its mass of entablature, is a disproportionate waste of 
energy. 

But although resistance to gravitation is the chief motive 
of proportion in architecture, it should equally govern 
every space and form of a building the size and shapes of 
the windows, and of the window-panes ; the amount of light 
and shadow ; the ornaments and enrichments, not only in 
their quantity, but in the mutual relations of their parts. 
A common means of attaining it is by lines or mouldings 
dividing the surface of a building into spaces, and giving 
emphasis where it is wanted. 

Such lines when drawn horizontally are called string 
courses. They originally were flat beds of solid stone going 
through the whole thickness of a wall composed of rough 
irregular materials, so as to strengthen the wall at intervals, 
usually at each floor, a level bed for the floor to rest on. 
The projecting edge was naturally ornamented with mould- 
ing or carving, and later on became a pure ornament of the 
architecture, seldom now going farther into the wall than 
the few inches necessary to fix it in its place, and I think it 
is legitimately used to give to the design the effect of hori- 
zontal division, though it does not necessarily indicate the 
precise position of the floors. Similar effects of proportion 
may be obtained by piers or pilasters dividing the building 
perpendicularly . 

Two houses at Miinster (fig. 4) show this mode of 
producing architectural effect. In the farther house, to the 
left of the picture, which is late Gothic in style, the idea of 
height is more dwelt on ; the upright lines, which take the 
form of pinnacles, are kept as a fringe on the outside of the 
gable ; in the other it is rather the horizontal lines that are 
enforced. Instead of the front running up into the gable, 
it is stopped by a strong cornice. The upright lines take 
the form of Classic pilasters. 

Mr. Fergusson disapproves of the use of pilasters, and, if 



38 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



he were Chancellor of the Exchequer, would put a pro- 
hibitory tax on them. But in every style of architecture 
effects of proportion have been obtained by enforcing the 
perpendicular or horizontal lines. The Greeks enforced the 
upright lines by fluting the columns. These bear the mass 
of entablature the frieze and cornice, the horizontal effect 
of which is heightened by the deep projection of the 
cornice, while the sense of weight in the mass is aided by

the tri glyphs of the frieze, which, even if they represent 
the beam-ends of old wood construction, are now purely 
ornamental features (see fig. 20, p. 56). 

In our ordinary town houses, where we have only a front 
to deal with in which the position of the windows- is fixed 
by necessity, such expedients are. almost our only means of 
obtaining architectural effect. Figs. 5 to 8 illustrate some 
modes of doing this common in Classic architecture. Fig. 5 
is the most naked form of building. In fig. 6 an appearance

of strength is given to the angles by building them of larger 
stones. The angles of the windows are also protected and en- 
riched by a framework round them, and dignity and shadow 
is given by ornamenting the cornice and increasing its size 
and projection. But if we repeat this process through the five 
or six stories of our London houses it becomes monotonous. 
Gothic delighted in height, but the tendency of Classic 
architecture was to dwell on the horizontal line, and various 




Fig. 7. 



expedients were resorted to to reduce the apparent height 
of the building. One was to bring down the strong line 
of the cornice, as in fig. 7, to the top of the main floor of 
the building, as if marking its importance and giving it 
dignity, and treating the rooms above as if they were only 
bedrooms, as 'an attic,' as it is called. In the old Italian 
palaces, where the great entertaining rooms were at the top 
of the house, it was fitting that the great cornice should be 
immediately over them.

Fig. 8 shows the common Classic mode of producing archi- 
tectural effect. The only architecture being in the orders 
derived from temples, the house is treated as a temple. The 
windows are accidents or necessary evils in the design. 
The ground floor is merely a base for a correct superstructure 



of columns and entablature. 




That it comprises two stories 
of the house is a regret- 
table accident which we 
must not dwell on. Yet 
noble effects have been 
gained by these means, 
and dignity and grace 
given to buildings other- 
wise dull. 

SYMMETRY, which may 
be considered a species 
of proportion, is almost 
essential to the noblest 
buildings at least when 
it is absent, whatever the 
other merits of the build- 
ing, the highest dignity is 
unattainable. In every 
style, Greek, Gothic, and 
Renaissance, symmetry 
controlled the designs of 



Fig. 9. HOUSE OPPOSITE THE CATHEDRAL AT 



In dwelling-houses, 
though often ruling the design as in this instance (fig. 9), 
it frequently gave way to the necessities of domestic 
convenience. It means that the parts on either side 
should be balanced and similar, not necessarily identical, 
like the two spires at the end of a modern church, 
both executed from the same drawing; but similar, like 



WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ARCHITECTURE? 



41 



those of an old cathedral, each retaining its own individu- 

ality. Of late years symmetry has not been much in 

favour. In the last century it was a universally acknow- 

ledged principle. That the door should not be in the 

centre was inconceivable. If the kitchens formed one 

wing the stables had exactly to match them in the other. 

The summer-house at one side of the garden had its 

duplicate on the other, even if it was half a mile off. 

Perhaps the Scotch gardener carried the principle too far, 

who shut up his son in one 

summer-house to balance a boy 

whom he had locked up in the 

other for stealing apples. Now- 

adays, we carry the opposite 

principle to an extreme. We 

put a spire at the side of a 

church rather than in the 

centre ; and where a door comes 

naturally in the middle of the 

house, we run up a gable on 

one side only to destroy the 

symmetry, under the delusion 

that we are carrying out Gothic 

principles.

It appears from this catalogue of the artistic effects 
which architecture is capable of producing, that they 
are widely various in kind, arid that many of them are 
incompatible with others. Now, for the perfection of 
any work of art, HARMONY is essential. All its various 
parts should suit one another. Nothing should be out 
of keeping. Ladies appreciate this principle in dress ; it 
would be absurd to wear a brilliant bonnet with a rough 
stuff gown. It is so much the essence of music that the 
word is used as a name for it, and it is the chief essential

in good colouring. And so in architecture it forbids 
discord; there must be no jarring, no part too rich or 
refined, or out of keeping with the rest. To strive after 
irregularity for its own sake is affectation, but when 
it arises naturally from the conditions of building, as 

in the little Scotch 
house (fig. 10, p. 41), it 
may be very pleasing. 
It is not the result of 
Imp-hazard, but comes 
through a sense of 
art and grace in the 
builders, of whicli they 
may have been quite 
unconscious. 

In the design of this 
house at Nuremberg, 
(fig. ll)the architectural 
effect is obtained with- 
out any ornament, solely 
by means of proportion, 
exercised in a skilful dis- 
position of the windows 
and roof. By simply 
lowering the wall in 
the centre, we get the 
effect of a mass of roof 
flanked by two towers. 
If the wall were built 
up between these towers 

to the level of their cornices, as a, London builder would 
have done, the design would be commonplace. It is irre- 
gular, but there is method in the irregularity. The neces- 
sities of internal arrangement make the towers different in 
size, but the centre of each is carried down and a feeling

of height given by the line of windows one above another. 
But for this, the horizontal line would have predominated, 
and there would have been no effect of towers in the 
design. 

Harmony is a universal law of Nature. In a few years 
she tones down the harshness of a new building, the rawness 
of rough scaur or broken rock with moss and lichens, into 
harmony and keeping with everything about it ; and in 
architecture, even when the forms are bad and the style 
feeble, mere harmony will sometimes produce the effect of 
beauty. 

We dispense with it in our modern architecture to a 
wonderful extent ; more than any time or nation hitherto 
has done. We think nothing of putting rich stained glass 
in a bare, white plastered interior, like a jewel in a swine's 
snout, or spotting the dingiest of cement house-fronts with 
flower-boxes made of the gaudiest coloured tiles, and making 
abortive attempts at art by furnishing our houses of common- 
place builders' Classic with fiercely Gothic furniture. 

On the other hand, so intent are we sometimes to obtain 
harmony, that we compel all the houses in a street to be made 
from the same design so that a man cannot tell his own 
except from the number on the door. In our restorations of 
old buildings it has been carried so far that immense quanti- 
ties of valuable art have been removed from our churches 
and destroyed as not of the same date as the rest of the 
building, in forge tfulness of the fact that these are historical 
monuments that their interest lies in each generation 
having left its mark on them that the impression of wealth 
and magnificence, and contrast also, produced by the rich 
Jacobean carvings so ruthlessly removed, are valuable effects 
in architecture, as well as harmony. Harmony consists 
rather in identity of feeling than of form or style. The 
quaint old Classic screens and tombs, the grace of Inigo 
Jones, and the elaborate richness of Grinling Gibbons, are 



44 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

in better keeping with the old buildings than the modern 
Gothic which, alas, has so often supplanted them ! 

Still harmony must be our rule, as it. is Nature's a rule 
not to be broken without cause to express some higher 
meaning, or to preserve some work our fathers have left us. 

CONTRAST is also a means of obtaining artistic effect, more 
telling than harmony, though not capable of producing such 
perfect results. An exquisitely carved and moulded window 
in a great field of plain wall looks more delicate itself, and 
makes the wall look grander. In Perpendicular Gothic, on 
the other hand, the tracery of the windows is carried over 
the walls, making the whole surface harmonious. This 
system was thoroughly carried out by Barry in the Houses 
of Parliament. But if the building has gained thereby in 
harmony and richness, it has lost in power. 

Who shall decide where and how far either principle shall 
be carried out ? what rules can we lay down ? Only the 
same as for composing poetry or music the insight and 
invention of the musician and the poet of one who has the 
power of composition, of so combining words or notes or 
colours as to express human feelings or ideas ; or, in archi- 
tecture, of one who can so use his materials as to produce 
a building possessing any of the artistic merits we have 
enumerated. 

In painting and architecture, the laws of composition are 
essentially the same : the same kind of considerations regulate 
the lines and masses of a picture and of a building. Its chief 
aim must be to produce unity, so that, however various the 
ideas it is concerned with, they shall unite in producing 
one idea, one work of art. 

ORNAMENT. Architecture can produce artistic effects of 
this kind without the aid of sculpture or painting or 
ornament of any kind, by the mere arrangement of masses

of building. Not even such an amount of ornament as a 
cable moulding is needed, without which Mr. Raskin thinks 
a mere utilitarian building, like a fortress, cannot be 
considered architecture. There is no ornament, not even 
the simplest chamfer, on these towers from the walls of 
Nuremberg (fig. 12); yet they are examples not of building 
only, but of architecture, and not unworthy of the designer, 
Albert Diirer. Are not grandeur and impressiveness artistic 
qualities ? and when old fortresses possess these by their

mass and strength, and the skill with which they are fitted 
to the rocks they crown and give dignity to, although 
they may be the most utilitarian of buildings, without a 
single ornament or moulding, they may possess the noblest 
qualities of architecture. The parapets in old castles 
projected on corbels, as in Borthwick Castle (fig. 13, p. 46), 
are not designed for ornament, but for the practical 
purpose of dropping down stones on assailants. 

But though architecture is possible without ornament, it 
cannot without it reach its most perfect manifestations. In 



46

the great ages of art, sculpture and painting had almost no 
existence except as its decorations. The Elgin Marbles are 
the decoration of a frieze ; the Theseus, a piece of architec- 
tural sculpture. In the Middle Ages sculpture was almost 
unknown, except as adorning doorways and other parts of 




Fig. 13. 



BORTHWICK CASTLE. 



buildings ; while the paintings of that time, and even of the 
great ages of Venetian and Roman art, were generally 
decorations of the walls or altars, and essential parts of the 
buildings. 

It may be questioned whether painting and sculpture 



WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ARCHITECTURE ? 47 

have gained by their present independence. Architecture 
certainly has lost one of the most powerful means of giving 
it interest. 

Ornament, when employed in architecture merely for its 
own sake, and because it is pretty, is weakness. It is 
valuable only when it assists the meaning of the design, 
enforcing certain lines or points and giving it richness or 
softness. For this purpose such an ornament as a Greek 

fret (figs. 14, 15) or a chevron ^fig. 16), 

or lines and dots (fig. 17), may be ^CTCICl CH 

not less suitable than the direct imita^ _ ir^-l^j - 

tion of natural objects, such as leaves or Fig - u- Fretl 
animals, probably more so ; for, as a 
building is necessarily largely composed 
of straight lines, straight-line ornament F . ]g Fret 
may harmonise with it better than the 
free and irregular curves of nature. As, in weaving, even 
a pattern on a table-cloth so simple as squares like a back- 
gammon board may be perfectly satisfactory and ornamen- 
tal because it is suitable to the material, and arises naturally 
from the processes of weaving. 
To follow the spirit of Na- 
ture, not to imitate her forms,

should be the aim ot art. 

I do not know whether 
even Mr. Ruskin himself now 
holds the theory, stated in ' Fig , 17 

' Seven Lamps of Architec- 
ture,' " that all beautiful lines are adaptations of those 
which are commonest in the external creation"- that in 
the Doric temple the cornice and triglyphs are not beautiful 
"because unimitative " that the fluting of the column 
derives what low beauty it possesses from its feeble resem- 
blance to " canaliculated organic structures." " The Roman- 
esque arch," he continues, " is beautiful as an abstract line. 




48 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

Its type is always before us in that of the apparent vault of 
heaven, and the horizon of the earth. The cylindrical 
pillar is always beautiful, for God has so moulded the stem 
of every tree that is pleasant to the eye. The pointed arch 
is beautiful ; it is the termination of every leaf that shakes 
in summer wind, and its most fortunate associations are 
directly borrowed from the trefoiled grass of the fields, or 
from the stars of its flowers. Farther than this man's 
invention could not reach without frank imitation. His 
next step was to gather the flowers themselves, and wreath 
them in his capitals." And again, ' I believe that we may 
reason from Frequency to Beauty, and vice versa ; that 
knowing a thing to be frequent (visibly frequent), we may 
assume it to be beautiful, and assume that which is most 
frequent to be most beautiful" "that forms which are not 
taken from natural objects must be ugly." 

On this ground Mr. Ruskiri "convicts" the Greek fret of 
" ugliness/' because it has no precedent for its arrangement 
but the forms of crystals of bismuth, an artificial condition of 
a rare metal. The theory is a total misconception of the 
whole meaning and use of ornament in architecture. It is 
a certain sign of weakness and decay when architectural 
ornament is a profuse imitation of natural forms. The beauty 
of the Doric column does not consist in its resemblance to 
some forms of reeds some Egyptian ones are much like 
reeds, but are coarse and clumsy in comparison but on its 
form being so perfectly contrived for supporting the weight, 
and on its flutings and the line of its capital so delicately 
marking this purpose ; just as the triglyphs have a meaning 
(whatever their origin), and therefore beauty, because they 
mark the downward pressure of this weight, and the cornice 
as giving protection and shadow. The beauty of Greek Doric 
does not consist in ornament, which would ruin it, but in 
its perfect proportion and delicacy of line. The Corinthian 
order, which is a close imitation of natural forms, is vulgar 



WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ARCHITECTURE? 49 

in comparison, and it was consequently a favourite with the 
more inartistic Eomans. Columns half the thickness would 
be iiker reeds ; triglyphs carved with natural leaves would 
not improve the temple. Without its sculpture, the Parthenon 
is still beautiful. No doubt it has lost the last finishing 
touch, but the loss is far less than that of its painting, and 
colour. Alter the relations of the weight of entablature 
to the supporting columns, or of the masses of light and 
shadow, and its beauty would be gone at once, and all its 
sculpture and painting would not restore it. 

That Mr. Ruskin's theory convicts the G-reek fret of 
ugliness is of itself sufficient to prove it false. If the old 
test, " quod semper, ubique, et ab omnibus," is any test of 
truth, the Greek fret can show a higher antiquity and a 
wider catholicity than any opinion or religion. In Asia, 
whence the Greeks probably got it, in India, in China, in 
Japan, it is a favourite ornament. It occurs frequently on 
the "sculptured stones of Scotland," and in caves once 
tenanted ; it is found in the New World on the pottery of 
Indian tribes in South America. Even Mr. Ruskin himself, 
though calling it a " horrible design," admits that it may be 
employed with advantage as an ornament on coins " when 
it is small," as it must be when so used, though it need not 
be small in proportion to the size of the coin. 

Accepting the fact that mankind regards it as an orna- 
ment, let us ask what there is in its form to make it so. May 
it not be because it is a succession of spirals architecturalised 
reduced to straight lines, and brought into harmony with 
the lines which, from its essential nature, are dominant in 
architecture ; just as the chevron, or the simplest form of 
Greek fret, would be a wave architecturalised ? Ornament 
composed of straight lines was no doubt first adopted in 
barbarous times because it was easily executed, but it con- 
tinued to be used in the most refined Greek buildings because 
it was felt to harmonise w T ith the architecture. The fret is

not a Gothic ornament, though something very like it is 
occasionally found among the scarce examples left of painted 
decorations in that style, which in those parts of the building 
not governed by curved lines of construction, abounded in 
ornament equally composed of straight lines, and equally 
unlike anything in nature ; such as, for example, the lines 
of "stoning " found on old Gothic buildings (fig. 18). 

The lines of archi- 
tecture and its orna- 
ment must of course 
be natural that is, 
they must be according 
to its nature and con- 
stitution ; for the imi- 
tation of animal or 
vegetable forms may, 
for it, be unnatural. 

It has an organism of its own a life which, like all life, 
evidences itself in resistance to gravitation, a character 
which is noble and beautiful when it fulfils the purposes 
of its being, and only that ornament is valuable which 
aids in expressing this. " The leaves which shake in the 
summer wind" are beautiful in their own place and way, 
but their forms may be utterly unnatural in architecture, 
and therefore ugly. Gothic arches are beautiful, not be- 
cause they are like leaf points an accurate imitation oi 
leaf points might make very ugly arches but because 
they are a true, excellent, and vigorous mode of construction. 
Mr. Buskin's theory of architectural ornament is opposed 
by the practical evidence of every style of architecture. 
Even when architectural ornament represents natural forms, 
it cannot do so by imitating them ; indeed, it is generally 
good in proportion as the resemblance is distant. Very 
little of the full beauty of a plant can be imitated in stone 
or wood-carving. The softness and colour and delicacy oi

nature are unattainable even in marble. The feeling of 
growth may be represented ; but this is often best done by 
not attempting accurately to imitate the form, which must 
be forced and stiffened, so as to have the nature of stone or 
wood put into it, and governed by the lines of the architec- 
ture, before it can become a harmonious part of wood or 
stone constructions. It may then be coloured simply, without 
any attempt at the gradations of Nature's colouring, with 
red, or white, or gold. The forms of honeysuckle, or of the 
rose or lily, are scarcely recognisable in the Greek honey- 
suckle ornament, in the Tudor rose, or the French fleur-de-lis, 
though these are much better ornaments in architecture 
or heraldry than a more exact imitation of the several 
plants. 

The term " conventional " has been applied to this treat- 
ment of ornament, as if it were only by a common agreement 
or understanding that it could stand for the natural objects 
it is supposed to represent. 

The aim of all architectural ornament, whether sculpture 
or painting or carving, is to give richness or expression to 
buildings ; and its excellence must be judged of, not by the 
accuracy with which it imitates nature, but by the extent 
to which it accomplishes its objects in harmony with the 
architecture. 

These modes of giving expression to buildings have been 
employed in different degrees by various nations, in their 
several styles of architecture. 

Mass and stability the sense of eternal duration seem 
to have been what the Egyptians aimed at in their buildings. 
They used stones of enormous size, and of the hardest kind, 
and long ranges of monolithic columns and figures. They 
built their walls sloping inwards, as being the most stable 
form of construction ; carrying this so far in the pyramids 
as to sacrifice to it every other kind of architectural expres- 



54 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

sion. Their ornament, grand, simple, and restrained in its 
lines, aided the general effect. They sometimes covered 
their walls with hieroglyphics, but the cutting was so 
shallow that it never destroyed the sense of mass. 

The engraving of the Temple of Karnac in Upper 
^oJP^ $&amp; -^) g lvessome inadequate notion of the gigantic 
size of the masses of the architecture. 

The Greeks worshipped beauty, and of all nations had 
the greatest success in realising it in its highest form of 
perfect proportion and exquisite purity and delicacy of 
line. 

In the architecture of their temples the construction was 
of the simplest and most primitive kind. In those of the 
Doric order, the purest and most characteristic expression 
of Greek art, the building is placed on a platform formed of 
great stones, in the finer temples of white marble, spreading 
out in steps so as to give the idea of perfect solidity. On 
this solid base the columns were placed. The Greek temple 
(see fig. 20) was not an enclosed building, but a portico 
built round the shrine of the god, giving shelter to the 
crowds who came to worship, from rain and sun, not from 
the cold. 

The Doric column is without a base, or that widening at 
its foot used in the columns of other styles of architecture 
to obviate the impression that the weight it carries might 
sink it into the ground ; because the platform looks solid 
enough to prevent any such impression arising. The 
column widens from top to bottom in a gentle entasis or 
curve, which counteracts the disagreeable appearance a 
simple cylinder would have had, of looking thinner at the 
bottom than in the middle and top. It is marked along its 
length with flutings, a series of slight hollows and edges, 
producing delicate gradated lines, which carry the eye 
along it and suggest its function of supporting weight. 



WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ARCHITECTURE ? 57 

To receive the weight it spreads out in the capital, on 
which is placed the abacus, a simple slab of stone. On these, 
stetching from column to column, rests the architrave, a 
series of solid square stone blocks. 

Above this is the frieze, which occupies the place of the 
roof beams of older wooden construction, the traces of which 
still remain in the triglyphs, representing notched beam 
ends. In the perfected architecture these fulfil the purpose 
of marking the downward pressure of the weight. On 
them rests the roof, 'which projects in the cornice, so as to 
throw the rain off the building, and which crowns it along 
its length with a mass of dark shadow. The roof is flat 
pitched, for the idea of length, rather than of height, rules 
the disposition of the architecture, and forms at the ends of 
the building low gables or pediments. 

Of architectural ornament there is none; there is no 
carving of the parts into flowers, or cable mouldings, such 
as Mr. Ruskin says makes the difference between architec- 
ture and building. The Greeks did not use sculpture like 
the Gothic architects, marking the construction and forming 
a part of it. Many temples, like this one of the group at 
Psestum, in the Greek colony of Magna Grecia, were with- 
out it. Where the Greeks used sculpture they set it in the 
pediments, grouping it so as to fit their triangular form, or 
filling up with it the spaces between the triglyphs ; but 
they never applied it or any representation of natural forms 
either to the base or architraves, or to the columns, which 
are the working members of the architecture. In these it 
would have tended to destroy the idea of Greek architecture, 
the expression of weight supported with perfect stability 
and perfect grace, which gives an impression of strength, 
repose, and beauty the highest attainable in architecture. 

Mr. Ruskin says it is not much to have done, to rest a 
lintel on the top of posts. There is nothing clever in it ; 
any infant can do it. The arch was a much cleverer thing 



58 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



to invent. The Greeks knew the arch and used it in 
drains underground, but they never showed it in their 
buildings. It would have destroyed their god-like repose ; 
they felt, as the Hindoos say, that "an arch never sleeps." 

The form of the perfect Greek temple was, doubtless, 
that of the earliest, which, with the persistency of religious 
traditions, has never been departed from. To the simple 
forms of Doric architecture the Greeks with their artistic 
instincts gave such exquisite proportion as to make it, while 
the race lasts, the standard of perfect beauty in architecture. 

The Romans were a practical people builders and 
engineers rather than architects. In the time of the Republic 
they seem to have had very little art, and scarcely a single 
building remains which was erected then. 

When, under the Empire, they commanded the wealth of 
the world, they were the greatest builders the world has 
seen. 

Every country they conquered still retains the traces of 
their occupation in the paved roads which led from Rome to 
the farthest station among the barbarians, permanent earn ps 
defended by towers and enclosed in a great square of 
massive walls, so admirably built that they have defied the 
weather and the continuous attempt to use them as quarries 
ever since, of aqueducts carried for miles over plains and 
bridging great rivers, baths with magnificent halls, basilicas 
or covered porticos for administering justice, temples, villas, 
theatres, and amphitheatres, where the fights would have 
lost their interest without the death of the conquered. 
The Flavian Amphitheatre, even in its ruins, fitly expresses 
this wealth and universal mastery. (Fig. 21.) 

In its system their architecture was that of rulers rather 
than of artists. It made admirable use of the means at 
its command. The Romans used the unskilled slave 
labour which they had in abundance in raising the masses 




GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. WESTMINSTER ABBEY. 






AVHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ARCHITECTURE ? 63 

of rough concrete and the great stones of their build- 
ings. They covered these with slabs of rich marble, 
or adorned them with ranges of arcades, rich vaulted 
ceilings, floors of mosaic, monolithic columns of marble 
and precious stones, and paintings arid sculptures by Greek 
artists. 

Their buildings were the expression of themselves 
powerful and practical rulers, with an outside coating of 
Greek culture, which had not become part of their own 
being, and which indeed they did not rightly understand. 
The splendour is all gone ; but wherever the Romans 
planted themselves, the solid masses of their buildings show 
the power which in Roman law and literature and art still 
rules our spirits from their urns. 

Gothic architecture also had its own expression, charac- 
teristic of the races who invented it. It used to be thought 
that the idea of a cathedral was derived from an avenue of 
trees the pillars representing the great trunks, the crossing 
vaulting ribs copied from the intermingling branches. The 
Gothic builders certainly never intended any such imitation ; 
their aims were much more practical. From copying, as 
well as they could, the remains of Roman architecture beside 
them, they were led, as we shall see, in the development of 
a mode of fireproof construction, to a new and characteristic 
style, which has in it the spirit of the forest and of the 
growth of vegetable life, just as Greek architecture has in it 
the spirit of the beauty of animal and human form. Their 
buildings express strength and vigour, sometimes almost 
savage, and high aspirations and striving, rather than 
repose, characteristic of the race that raised them and of 
the faith they held. 

In the same way every natural architecture expresses the 
mental characteristics of the people among whom it has 
grown up. We understand most Eastern peoples too little 



64 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

to judge how far the same is true in their case. The 
Hindoos have expressed in their architecture, their love of 
subtilty and intricacy and minute refinement, their patient 
laboriousness and their want of grandeur of character. 

At the time of the Renaissance, or Revival of the fifteenth 
and sixteenth centuries, the whole social system, the philo- 
sophy and the art of the Middle Ages, which had served 
their time, and the religious faith also in great measure, were 
broken up. 

The rediscovered literature of the Greeks and Romans 
flooded men's minds with a new light which made the 
previous ages seem dark. Beside the massive grandeur 
and simplicity of the old Roman architecture, the worn-out 
Gothic seemed everywhere trifling. Ancient literature and 
art were deemed Classical, the standards of perfection. 

The forms of classic art were universally accepted, but 
the Gothic spirit, still vigorous among the northern nations, 
worked them out into a new architecture, thoroughly Gothic 
in spirit, with a character which for want of a better name 
we call picturesqueness. Its effect seems due to happy 
accidents, and is rather marred by the regularity and 
symmetry which ruled every previous style of architecture, 
including Gothic. 

For the irregularity which we find in many old Gothic 
buildings was not part of their original design. The 
Strassburgers at first intended that their cathedral should 
have two western towers, but, when they determined to 
have a higher spire than any other city, they felt that the 
symmetry became absurd and abandoned the building of 
the second spire. A similar feeling probably influenced 
the builders at Cologne, and when its two western towers 
are finished, I believe the result will show that in finishing 
only one tower the Gothic builder was right. 

The sense of freedom and emancipation which the Revival

brought, mingling with older mediaeval ideas, showed itself 
in the architecture of which the Church of St. ^tienne du . 
Mont, beside the Pantheon at Paris, seems to me a typical 
example. There is a richness and sumptuousness in the 
building which express the increase of physical well-being 
and the joy in physical life of the times. In features and 
ornament the design is mainly Classic, but there is nothing 
of Classic repose or correctness. The pediments are broken 
and twisted into curves, and the Classic mouldings and 
ornaments are altered with a freedom which horrifies Classic 
purists. The old Gothic spirit shows itself in the general 
form, in the high-peaked roof, and in the movement and 
energy of the design. The general effect of the design is 
rich picturesque confusion, which fitly expressed the spirit 
of the times which produced it; perhaps also of our own. 

Such are the characteristics of the styles of architecture 
which we know best, but they do not exhaust the effects 
which architecture can produce ; for if it expresses human 
feelings and ideas, it must be infinite in its manifestations ; 
and every original building will have some new form of 
expression. 

It is impossible to lay down any laws by which good 
architecture can be produced or tested. It would be a 
great comfort if we could have fixed tests in art criticism 
to decide what is beautiful ; but no law was ever kid down 
which a great artist could not break, and yet at the same 
time produce good art. Sir Joshua Reynolds said that no 
picture could be harmonious in which blue preponderated, 
and Gainsborough painted his ' Blue Boy.' It is a law of 
composition in painting, that a principal figure should not 
be placed in the centre of a picture ; yet artists have put it 
there, and the picture has looked all right. 

Such laws only mean that the harmony they forbid is 
difficult ; when it is achieved, the success is all the greater.

Blue and green are supposed not to go together; yet, in 
other instances besides trees against the sky, it is the most 
exquisite of harmonies. As well say that the music of a 
fiddle is harsh; yes, as we hear it in steamboats. Yet some 
people would prefer a popular air so played to a sonata of 
Beethoven performed by Joachim. 

Who is to decide ? In architecture, as in music, the test 
of excellence is the approval of those who combine 
technical knowledge of the art with an inborn power oi 
appreciating it. Art criticism consists in some one wh( 
possesses this power telling how an art production affects 
him, its value depending on the truth and delicacy of his 
judgment ; or else in his giving the public such information 
that they can see from the same point of view as himself. 

When a subject is of national interest, the sense of the 
community itself perceives a certain way, and, when doubt- 
ful of its own opinions, knows whose it ought to trust, so 
that it comes to have settled and well-grounded judgments ; 
while those who know nothing of the subject are made 
aware, by the general sentiment, that they are not entitled 
to have opinions of their own. 

When the nation generally does not care for an art (as is 
our own case at present with regard to architecture), and has 
little knowledge of it, it appreciates its coarse -and vulgar 
manifestations (which, like popular airs, appeal to lower 
but more widely-spread sympathies) better than its most 
exquisite refinements. In art criticism the public do not 
know whom to trust. The mere accident of the critic being 
in a good position in society, or being an eloquent writer, 
or knowing a little of the subject and being very rich, if he 
is an amateur ; or, if he is an architect, being a good business 
manager, are common reasons with us for recognising a 
man's authority on architectural subjects ; and, the art not 
being generally understood, we seldom meet any one who 
does not consider himself a perfectly competent judge of the 









WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD ARCHITECTURE? 69 



merits of a building. The ultimate object of architecture is 
no doubt, to please the public, not the architects ; but if, at 
first, it pleases only an ignorant public, it will soon be dis- 
tasteful even to them. Its flashy crudities will pall, like 
popular airs, but unfortunately its permanence forbids us 
forgetting it as we do these. 

Of the artistic effects of architecture enumerated in this 
chapter, many, such especially as grandeur or sublimity, 
would be out of place in ordinary houses. They are attain- 
able in palaces ; some of which, notably those of Florence, 
are as impressive in their architecture as great religious 
buildings. 

Nowadays palaces generally are only larger houses to 
accommodate a large establishment. State and grandeur 
have become irksome to us, and are even despised, no doubt 
because so frequently the sign of power which has departed ; 
and the sense of power consequently seems more exquisite 
to us when unencumbered by its trappings. Comfort and 
convenience are all that are insisted on . 

This change is not advantageous to the development of 
the highest type of domestic architecture ; but there is 
still room for better art in modern houses than is usually 
attained. To express our domestic life, it should be more 
pleasing than impressive, more beautiful than grand, 
characterised by refinement rather than by state.

CHAPTER III. 



THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR PRODUCING GOOD 
ARCHITECTURE. 



WHY is it, that with all our mechanical skill and 
appliances, with a power of construction, and a 
knowledge of the art of all times which the world never 
before possessed, our own productions in architecture are 
inferior, in art and in grandeur, to those of our ancestors in 
the Middle Ages, who had not a tithe of our wealth or 
knowledge that the churches we build are only imitations 
(often far enough off) of theirs, while our best houses are 
far inferior to those of Elizabeth's time ? Not only are we 
incapable of rivalling the granite structures of Egypt, or 
the marble ones of Greece, but in truth and perfection 
of architecture we have been distanced even by poor and 
half-savage nations. 

The causes of this are an interesting subject of investi- 
gation, even apart from the chance that a knowledge of 
them may help us to do better. 

It may perhaps be said, to account for our undoubted 
inferiority, that we are not a building race like the 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 71 

Egyptians, or an artistic people like the Greeks. .But our 
cathedrals and our old mansions show that, in our own way, 
we were once both great builders and great artists. 

It might be urged that this is not a building age that 
our life is too hurried, our minds too unsettled, for works 
of permanence. A man seldom now looks forward to living 
in the same house all his life ; he regards it with no love, 
and does not care what it is like, if it is water-tight and 
large enough. But with a population rapidly increasing 
in numbers and wealth, and in the desire for greater comfort 
and magnificence, we must go on building houses, and in 
fact the ground was never more rapidly covered not with 
mere tents for shelter, but with houses often absorbing 
much of the new-made wealth. We build even for the 
pleasure of it, pulling down our cities to re-construct them 
with wider streets and handsomer buildings. The country 
has been studded with new churches ; and public bodies, 
from the Government to small town corporations, engage 
eagerly in erecting "all sorts of buildings, almost all with 
some attempt at architectural magnificence. It is not, then, 
want of wealth, nor of desire for art and grandeur, nor that 
the necessary talent is not born among us, nor a want of 
constructive skill, which makes our architecture a failure, as 
compared to the old, very much in proportion as it departs 
from the old forms. Nor is it ignorance, for we have a 
knowledge of the styles and buildings of the world such 
as no age ever had before, not by description merely, but 
in drawings, measured' so accurately that we might re- 
produce the buildings. 

The cause is not far to seek : it lay in the method or 
system under which, the old styles were practised, by means 
of which success in what they aimed at was universally 
achieved. 

These old styles were traditional. They each contained 
the accumulated experience of the time and country, which 



72 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

had grown up gradually during centuries, each age having 
its own methods, being confident that they were the best, 
and incapable of even conceiving of any other. For all 
men under the same influences of climate, race, and religion, 
there was one style of architecture as there was one 
language. As the people changed, their style changed 
with them. Rude and barbarous at first, it was gradually 
refined and improved ; and it decayed with the decay 
of the nation, or of the social arrangements within the 
nation with which it had arisen. Changes were not made 
in it for the sake of change, any more than new words are 
invented without cause ; but it was not stereotyped each 
tried to improve on what had been done before. Con- 
structive and artistic problems were gradually solved; 
imperfections, crudeness and errors corrected ; till, having 
arrived at its highest perfection, the necessity of change in 
all living things gave it some new aim, generally lower, 
less simple and true. 

The same system is followed in painting and in all the 
arts, and it is the only one by which constant success has 
been attained. Though each sees but a little way, he has 
the advantage of the thought, the discoveries, and the failures 
of his predecessors ; his work is cut out for him to make 
use of, and improve on them. If it is essential to success 
in painting, where the picture is the work of a single man, 
it is a hundred times more so in architecture, where the 
labours of many men and of a dozen different trades and 
arts must be united in the construction of a building. 

An art conducted in this way must always be right, 
for it is natural and true ; always interesting and worthy 
of study, as reflecting the thoughts and feelings of the 
people, their character and history, how they influenced 
surrounding nations, or were influenced by them. Its laws 
and development are as regular as those of nature. We 
can almost reconstruct an old building, and tell its date 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 73 

from a scrap of its mouldings, as Professor Owen could an 
extinct animal from one of its bones. 

Architecture with us at present works under very dif- 
ferent conditions. Instead of one settled style, which every 
one understands, and in which all workmen and artists are 
trained, we try Gothic one day, in all its modifications, 
from Norman to Perpendicular, and the next, every possible 
variety of Italian Classic, with an occasional change to 
Greek, Chinese, or Hindoo. In regard to each of them, we 
are in the position of a schoolboy making Latin verses. 
By the help of dictionaries, and a knowledge of the best 
originals, he may correctly and elegantly express even 
modern thoughts and feelings ; but his work is not living 
art, and can have no human interest except in determining 
his place at an examination, by showing how closely he 
can copy. 

This system of copying arose in the fifteenth century 
with that enthusiasm for everything Classic, which tried to 
reproduce, not merely the language and architecture, but 
even the dress and mode of life, of ancient Rome. But 
there are earlier instances in England of copying before the 
Classic mania commenced. In the western part of the nave 
of Westminster Abbey, built in Henry YII/s time, the 
style of the older work is copied so closely that few but 
architects notice the difference. The arches have the same 
form as in the earlier work, but the mouldings are per- 
pendicular in character. In so doing, the builders were 
no doubt artistically right, but it would have been im- 
possible for them if they had thoroughly believed in their 
own style. 

The vitality of the native style was spent. It was 
to succumb to the first invader, and the revived Roman 
art being received as the outward expression of the new 
intellectual life, spread resistlessly throughout Europe, 
irrespective of creed, among Catholics, Protestants, and

Jews*, and has since been carried over the world with 
modern civilisation. Spanish, Dutch, and English settlers 
took it with them to America. Later emigrations have 
localised it in our new colonies. The Hindoos are copying 
their masters in this as in other things; and the Turks 
are now adopting it as a sign of their capacity for Western 
civilisation. 

This system of copying, which pronounces architecture 
good and correct, the more closely it resembles some style 
long since obsolete, produces results very different from the 
old, natural method. Instead of changing and advancing 
with the life of the nation, it has a tendency to go back to 
its starting-point. At first the old model is not under- 
stood, and modern elements are mingled with it ; just as a 
boy, writing . Latin verses, will at first destroy their purity 
with English idioms and constructions, all traces of which 
he may succeed in removing, when he becomes better 
acquainted with the originals. The style is subject to 
continual aberrations, making its course not progress, but 
see-saw ; for it is dependent not on the accumulated labours 
of generations, but on the knowledge and caprice of 
individuals. 

The earliest Classic in France and England, and wherever 
else, as in Yenice, the old style was vigorous, was half 
Gothic, but gradually it became more classically correct and 
uninteresting. Our earliest revived Gothic at Strawberry 
Hill is really the ordinary builders' Classic of the period, 
with some pointed windows in it, and ridiculous imitations 
of Gothic mouldings. The Perpendicular churches of 
thirty years ago are better, but no one could mistake 
them, like some we build now, for old ones. Since that 
time, the Gothic style, especially in its earlier and more 
perfect development, has been thoroughly studied and illus- 
trated; some of the churches built in it being nearly as 
good as old ones, showing here and there modern develop- 






CONDITIOXS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 75 

ments, while a very few are accurate to the minutest 
particulars. Gothic architects, however, do not acknow- 
ledge that absolute obligation of old authority, which ulti j 
mately deprived the revived Classic of spontaneous life. 
Those who have known the style so well as to be imbued 
with its spirit, have produced works both original and 
true ; but Gothic freedom has oftener merely meant liberty 
to go wrong. 

One of the worst effects of this system of copying is, that 
the striving after correctness and perfect imitation of the 
dead standard leads to the adoption of features unsuited to 
modern wants. Great porticoes block up the windows of 
English country houses ; " the orders," with their propor- 
tions immutably fixed, trammel and spoil the designs; 
great pillars block up chapels built for preaching in, and 
windows in houses are made pointed, rendering their wood- 
work inconvenient and window-blinds impossible. 

The evils of copying are multiplied and aggravated when, 
as at present, we attempt a number of styles at the same 
time. When only one style was practised, there was some 
chance of its being understood, at least by experts and 
by the learned ; and of its being correct, though to the 
public uninteresting and unintelligible. How can any 
one master the principles and details of half-a-dozen styles, 
so as not only to know them correctly, but to enter into 
their spirit so thoroughly as to be able to compose in them ? 
Some one told Wordsworth of a friend of his who knew 
seven languages. " Indeed," he replied ; " there are few 
people who know their own." Ordinary architects have 
about as much knowledge of the different styles they 
practise in succession, as couriers have of the half-dozen 
languages they profess to speak. 

Half-a-dozen different sets of laws being in vogue some 
opposed in principle, and some, those of Gothic especially, 
proclaiming the right of variety and individual freedom 



76 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



ignorant architects, instead of following old work, perfected 
by the continuous labour of ages, dignify their own crude 
conceptions with the name of originality. 

While we confined ourselves to Classic there was a standard 
which, though a dead one, recognised as essential an adher- 
ence to laws of proportion and harmony, which experience 
had gradually perfected. Correct dulness was often the 
result, but we were at least saved from the utter defiance of 
these laws, which make some late specimens of modern 
Gothic the most impudent and offensive erections which the 
depravity and ignorance of man has perpetrated. 

When a profession is established on fixed principles, like 
medicine or law, those who need its assistance may go to a 
village doctor or attorney, confident that they will be well 
advised, according to the best light of the age ; just as in 
old times, when there was only one style, village masons 
built good G-othic churches or Classic houses. If we 
practised indiscriminately French and English law, with 
their variations through five centuries, and a man could 
elect to have his case decided by the law as it existed at anv 
period in either country, only the most extensive reading 
and knowledge could fit a lawyer for his profession, and 
those who understood their work would be very few. The 
actual state of architecture is nearly as absurd as this wild 
imagination. 

If this is true of those whose business it is to know it 
(and that it is so is shrieked through the land by music-halls 
and cemetery chapels), what hope can the public, who have 
no training in it, have of understanding its principles ? To 
the unlearned and ignorant all its styles must be unknown 
tongues. 

Similar views as to the advantage of the system 
under which old architecture was produced, have been 
expressed by Mr. Fergusson in his able and interesting 
4 History of Architecture ' and throughout his works. But, 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 77 

as to the remedy for tlie present state of things, opinions 
differ. 

*' The great change which was introduced at the Refor- 
mation," Mr. Fergusson says, "was this. A Technic art 
came to be cultivated on principles which belong only to 
one of the Phonetic class ;" that is to say, architecture, 
which is only the useful art of building elevated to a fine 
art, as " cooking may be refined into gastronomy and 
tailoring into an important art without a name," came to be 
treated as if it were like poetry, painting, or sculpture, one 
of the phonetic arts, " merely different modes in which 
men's thoughts can be communicated to other men, or 
perpetuated for the use of posterity." In the technic or 
useful arts, those, for instance, connected with food, cloth- 
ing, or shelter, progress has been slow and gradual. Each 
worker is heir of an accumulated experience, so that any 
mechanic can now make a better steam-engine than Watt : 
"as in India, at this hour, local masons, who can neither 
read, write, nor draw, can design as beautiful buildings as 
ever graced that land." But in the phonetic arts, poetry, 
painting, sculpture, "the individual stamps the value." 
" We do not now find men writing better epics than 
Homer, or better dramas than Shakespeare. We do not 
see finer sculptures than those of Phidias, or more beautiful 
paintings than those of Raphael." " No one dreams," 
therefore, " of altering a poem or of improving a statue 
or picture, though they may be the production of inferior 
artists. But in the Middle Ages no one ever hesitated to 
rebuild the nave of a cathedral, or to add towers or chapels 
in the newest fashion to the oldest churches," just as " no 
Comptroller of the Navy ever hesitated to cut one of Sir 
W. Symond's ships in two, if by lengthening her he could 
improve her qualities." " No one has cared to record the 
names of the designers of the medieval cathedrals ; pro- 
bably nobody knew who the architects were. The art was 



78 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

a true art ; it was more difficult to do wrong then than to 
do right now. No genius, however great, could then 
enable an individual to get much ahead of his compeers, 
while the most ordinary ability enabled any one to do as 
well as the rest." But " the individual is now everything 
in architectural art, while the age is of as little importance 
as in a poem or a picture." And so " it would be con- 
sidered sacrilege to meddle with or attempt to improve 
St. PauFs Cathedral, out of respect for Wren " (I only wish 
it were so considered), " and Blenheim, must remain the 
most uncomfortable of palaces, because it was so left by 
Van br ugh." " The new system subjects art to the caprices 
arid vagaries of individuals/' " What a man learns in his 
lifetime dies with him ;" " his successor has to begin at the 
beginning ;" " their careers probably cross each other." 
" An architect in practice can never afford many hours to 
the artistic elaboration of his design," arid hence " the 
remarkably small amount of thought that a modern building 
ever displays. The evil has been aggravated in modern 
times by architecture being handed over too exclusively 
to professional men who live by it, and generally succeed 
more from their businesslike habits than their artistic 
powers." In conclusion, Mr. Fergusson says that, " without 
a reorganization of the whole system, we must be content 
to allow copying to the fullest extent, and must be satisfied 
with shams, either Classical or Medieval, until at least the 
public are better instructed, and demand or initiate a 
recurrence to the principles that guided the architects of 
those ages when true and real buildings were produced." 

I do not think it is a straining of Mr. Fergusson's 
opinions to say that his view is that, under the present 
system in which architects direct the construction of build- 
ings, by means of drawings, good architecture cannot be 
produced, and that we should return to the system of the 
" true styles," when there were no architects, in the modern 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 79 

sense, but the employer communicated directly with the 
workman who executed the work ; in fact, that architects 
should be dispensed with. 

These opinions of Mr. Fergusson were restated in three 
articles in the ' Quarterly Review,' entitled " The State of 
English Architecture" (April 1872) ; " The Completion 
of St. Paul's" (December 1872); and the "Hope of 
English Architecture " (December 1874). In these articles 
the writer argues that in Greece, Rome, and mediaeval 
England (which last, with more patriotism than accuracy, 
he says, was " for six centuries the finest scene of architec- 
tural display that the world ever saw "), as well as on the 
Continent, architecture was produced not by architects 
directing workmen by means of drawings, but by men 
who, while working with their own hands, had charge of 
their fellows as foremen or master- workmen. He quotes 
numerous cases in proof of this from Mr. Street's book on 
Spanish Architecture, in a tone which seems to imply that 
he convicts Mr. Street of inconsistency in relating them 
and yet continuing to practise as an architect, on the system 
now prevalent. His latest article concludes as follows : 
" Such was the master workman of the past, whose free 
imaginative power has ever been the life of art; and in like 
manner the emancipated workman, gloriously 'impelled,' 
must always be, and is, the only real hope of English archi- 
tecture." He expresses his hostility to architects unre- 
strainedly. " These eminent persons," he says, " have been 
the bane of art for the last three hundred years." Again, 
he calls them, " A spurious, we had almost said a quack 
profession ;" and again, he says, " There will then be no 
need of the 'profession,' and architects will subside into 
their proper places as bookmakers, artists, business men, 
students of symbolism and archaeology, and, in fact, pupils 
and illustrators of those very workmen whom they now 
profess to direct and to control." 



80 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

The opinions above recited assert or imply riot only that, 
in the best times of the art architecture was produced 
without architects, but that this is the only right way of 
producing it. If they have any practical meaning, and are 
to influence the conduct of any one in the present day 
who is thinking of building, they amount to an advice 
to him not to go to an architect for his plans, but to 
work them out himself with some intelligent foreman or 
builder. 

The subject is of importance, not only to architects, but 
to the public, who, I believe, would get worse architecture 
than they get even at present, if they attempted to put 
the advice into practice. 

Mr. Fergusson believes that our modern architecture is 
bad, because since the Reformation the art has been con- 
ducted on a false method ; that whereas it is a " technic " 
art, it has been treated as if it were a " phonetic " art, like 
sculpture or poetry; and that instead of developing by a 
natural process of evolution, it has been under the control 
of individuals. 

This distinction has not, I think, any existence in reality. 
The arts which Mr. Fergusson calls " phonetic " do not 
arise out of the gift of speech, as Mr. Fergusson asserts, but 
are rather substitutes for speech. He seems to have classi- 
fied the arts as technic and phonetic, putting aside the 
familiar distinction of the arts as useful and fine, in order 
to avoid classing architecture as a fine art with painting and 
poetry. But in truth the distinction between these arts 
does not lie in the subject-matter of the art, but in the 
manner of treatment. Any useful art may become a fine 
art by having added to it the element of fineness of beauty 
of colour or form, or of expression, that is, any element 
making it the vehicle of human feeling or emotion, such as 
tenderness, gladness, solemnity, or even, perhaps, mere 
refinement and perfection in work. u Every useful art," 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 81 

Mr. Fergusson admits, " is capable of being refined into a 
fine art." 

Architecture is not only a fine art, but it is included in 
Mr. Fergusson's definition of the "phonetic" arts, being 
one of the noblest and most lasting " modes by which men's 
thoughts can be communicated to other men, or perpetuated 
for the use of posterity." 

NOAV, one of the results of an art developing into a fine 
art is that, the art expressing the personal emotions and 
feelings of the artist, we come to have an interest in his 
personality. We resent the alteration and interference of 
others, as destroying the value of the work the art becomes 
individual. 

This, at least, is the case in our present state of society 
and civilisation. But in certain states of society we find 
arts flourishing in what we may call a traditional manner. 
Their origin is lost in the past. They are handed down 
from father to son. They are understood by the whole 
community, and seem the expression of the national 
character. Their progress is slow and gradual, and we 
can measure it only by comparing the productions of the 
art at long intervals. This is what Mr. Fergusson means 
by a " true " style of architecture. But he is in error in 
saying that architecture differs in this from poetry and 
other arts ; for, in primitive states of society, we cannot 
recognise the individual inventors in poetry and sculpture 
any more than in architecture. They are lost in the 
community, or in a school of poets or sculptors handing 
down a tradition. In them as in architecture the age seems 
everything, the individual little or nothing. Mr. Fergusson 
ranks Homer with Shakespeare, as both equally historical 
personages. But few now hold that the poems of Homer 
are the work of any one man. They and other early Greek 
poems come to us as the collected traditions of the schools 
of professional singers and rhapsodists, who recited them at 

VOL. I. G 



82 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

the public festivals. In the early history of every race 
literature and all the arts exhibit the same characteristic. 
The folk's lore and national tales, characteristic of the genius 
of each people, even when traceable to some source common 
to them with other races, and the national proverbs are all 
authorless, so far as we know, and with as much truth as a 
style of architecture or ornament might be said to be the 
result of slow accretions of tradition. But no one would 
think of calling only such national poetry and literature 
true, and what has been written by poets whose names we 
know false, or of lamenting that under our modern system 
literature had lost its ethnological value. 

The art of sculpture was practised in the same anonymous 
traditional manner. It was a useful art to begin with to 
supply idols for worship, of the rudest kind, as we see from 
those lately found at Hissarlik (claimed as the site of Troy). 
The growing refinement of the Greek race, which tingled 
with art to the finger tips, in time made these statues of 
the gods the highest expression of art which the world 
has seen. Early Greek coins show a slowly developing 
tradition. The later coins of Syracuse are signed by their 
engravers. 

It is the same in the art of music ; each nation has its 
national airs, breathing the spirit and sentiment of the race, 
handed down by tradition, and doubtless changing and 
growing as each musician passed them on. But since the 
time of Palestrina, composers, like architects, have asserted 
their individuality, and the history of music, like that of 
architecture, as Mr. Fergusson complains, has become an 
account of the lives of inventors. 

In other departments the same thing is seen. Any ship 
carpenter used to be able to build a ship about as well 
as any other. Now we have individual inventors ; and 
though this takes from us the safety of slow progress, 
and renders us liable to a fiasco like the Great Eastern, no 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 83 

one thinks of urging that the designing of ships should be 
relegated back to the working carpenters. 

In like manner the so-called phonetic art of painting has 
passed through a stage similar to that of the " true " styles 
of architecture the state in which it was in Italy when 
Cimabue gave it life, in which it still exists, in the supply 
of pictures for Greek churches a fine art in a sense, not 
without a sort of beauty, under its conditions a tradition 
transmitted by common workmen, gradually changing with 
the advancement or decline of the race. 

The state of society in which the arts are traditional, is a 
state of stagnation. There is a very small stock of ideas 
common to all the tribe ; every man thinks exactly as his 
neighbour and as his fathers did before him. All wisdom 
comes from them, and the old men as nearest the source are 
the sole repositories of truth. New ideas are regarded as 
blasphemy, and if they spring up are crushed out by the 
common sense of the people. The thoughts and ways of 
other nations are regarded with hatred as things the earth 
should be purged of; or, if with tolerance, as strange and 
inconceivable. Customs are often circumscribed in the 
narrowest districts : each village has its own peculiar dress, 
each district its own type of building. 

The period during which a nation may remain in such 
a state is absolutely indefinite. Many savage tribes appear 
never to have changed since the stone age. The East is 
still much as it was in the time of Moses, and from its daily 
life supplies illustrations of Biblical customs. The break- 
ing up of such a state of things, is always an epoch in a 
nation's history, filling it with the gladness of new birth. 

It came to the Florentines, in the art of painting, when 
Cimabue for the first time painted a Madonna with some 
touch of human feeling when he made the art phonetic, as 
Mr. Fergusson would say ; and, however feeble the flicker

Maria Novella, may seem to us who know what the life 
grew to of which it was the germ, it filled the people with 
such joy that they carried it with shouting and triumph 
through the streets ; so that to this day the suburb through 
which it passed is called the Borgo Leto. 

In our own day a new birth has come to the Japanese, 
affecting not their art only, but their social state and all 
their customs. Their art, which to us was a new sensation, 
seems now crude and barbarous to themselves. They are 
delighted with the new idea of perspective and distance. 
Marching in the ranks of European civilisation, they glory 
in black trousers and tail coats, as the outward and sensible 
sign of their new inward life. One who was present in 
Japan during the change told me that though the command 
of the Mikado, believed to be divine, was needed to start 
the nation on its new road, even that would be powerless 
now to arrest it. 

The same sort of thing is happening everywhere. Travel 
is losing its interest, for every place is getting like every 
other. The beautiful national costumes of Norway are dis- 
appearing. All our own old ways are dying out. The 
Grreat Exhibition of 1851, it has been not untruly said, 
destroyed the last remnants of art in England. Everywhere, 
the old traditional arts are perishing. New Turkey carpets 
are harsh and bad in colour. We only know what their 
colour once was when we see an old one in some country 
house where the furniture has been unchanged for a 
century. Every year, in India, carpets with the exquisite 
old colour have to be sought for farther up the country. If 
Mr. Fergusson went back there, I fear now he might not 
find his village mason building the traditional tombs. In 
Persia the art of carpet weaving has perished, by the 
destruction of the old weavers in the famine, and the 
country has taken to European ways. All over the East 
the art which has lived there since the days when the

mother of Sisera looked for her son returning from battle 
with " a prey of divers colours of needlework," is disappear- 
ing. Our age of steam and universal inter-communication 
is witnessing the destruction everywhere of arts which have 
their roots in the earliest traditions of the race. Their con- 
tinued transmission depended on a stagnant social condition. 
When that is broken up they perish with it. It is sad, but it 
is inevitable ; for, once a man has known individual freedom, 
he can never again be a mere transmitter of tradition. 

And this is the age in which Mr. Fergusson tells us to 
return to those old ways in architecture, which he says we 
gave up three centuries ago. He might as well tell the 
dead to rise. His ' History of Architecture of all Countries 
from the Earliest Times to the Present Day,' is of itself a 
proof that we have emerged from the state which conceives 
its traditional ways the only possible ones that we can 
appreciate new and foreign ideas. If they seem better to 
us, we are sure to follow them under the guidance of their 
originators, not of common workmen who do not understand 
them. 

There is thus no ground, in fact, for Mr. Fergusson's 
division of arts into phonetic and technic ; the first produced 
by individuals, whose names we know ; the latter anonymous, 
transmitted by tradition, and, advancing by the slow im- 
provements of ordinary and unknown men ; anonymity 
and transmission by tradition have been at certain times a 
condition of all other arts as well as of architecture. 

Equally erroneous is the assertion, on which depends Mr. 
Fergusson's division of the history of architecture into two- 
rnarkedly different periods, that, till the Reformation, the so- 
called true system everywhere prevailed ; and that, since 
then, the . so-called false system has prevailed throughout 
Europe. 

It is no doubt true that most of the old styles of arcbitec- 



86 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

ture, especially those which continue, as in India, to the 
present day, were practised by common workmen during 
long periods as traditional styles, and continued gradually 
progressing without any such change as to be marked by 
the names of the architects. But I think it can be shown 
that this is not true as regards the rise of Gothic architec- 
ture. It arose in France in the building of the great 
cathedrals, during a period of remarkable social and mental 
activity, when the towns threw off the fetters of the feudal 
system, and gained their liberties and the right of having 
walls. It was an outcome of that Eenaissance within the 
Middle Ages, which produced the free thought of Abelard, 
the love poetry of Provence, the new music of rhyme. The 
rise of the new architecture was rapid, the whole of the 
French cathedrals having been built and left almost as we 
find them within a period of eighty years. 

It was not a slow improvement of traditional ideas by 
unknown workmen. On the contrary, we find in it one of 
Mr. Fergusson's characteristics of a u false " style ; we know 
the names of the architects. 1 They seem in many cases to 
have been laymen, judging from their names and the lay- 
man's dress in which some of them are represented on their 
tombs. 

In the centre of a labyrinth marked in lines on the pave- 
ment of Amiens Cathedral, lately destroyed, were engraved 
the names of the " masters," who in succession directed the 
works in the beginning of the thirteenth century Robert 
de Luzarches, Thomas de Cormont, and his son Regnault. 
Peter of Montereau, in 1240, was commissioned by St. Louis 
to build the Sainte Chapelle at Paris. With his wife he 
was buried in the choir of the Lady Chapel of St. Germain 
des Pie's, now destroyed, which also he designed. 

1 The Cistercian Abbeys in Yorkshire, which are the earliest pure Gothic works in 
this country, seem to have been the works of the monks themselves. William of Sens 
and William " the Englishman," were both Benedictine monks. 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 87 

Libergier was the architect of the very perfect Church 
of St. Nicaise, at Rheims, as his tombstone, removed on the 
destruction of the church to the cathedral, tells us. Peter 
de Corbie built several churches in Picardy, and probably 
Yiollet-le-Duc thought the chapels of the apse of Rheims. 
John de Chelles constructed, in 1257, the gables of the 
transept, and the first chapels of the choir of the Cathedral 
of Paris. In 1277, Erwin of Steinbach commenced the 
great doorway of the Cathedral of Strassburg. 

The names of the masters who directed the work at 
Rheirns, Noyon, Laon, and built the fa9ade of Paris, are 
lost ; as, they well might be, from the lapse of centuries arid 
the destruction of records in France. But the instances 
given, collected by Viollet-le-Duc, show that Mr. Fergusson 
is wrong in stating that no one seems to have cared to 
preserve the names of the designers of the Mediaeval 
cathedrals. The preservation of Villars de Honnecourt's 
sketch-book shows that the small respect in which the 
Reviewer holds architects and their drawings was not 
the feeling of the thirteenth century. 1 

The Reviewer and Mr. Fergusson may, perhaps, answer 
that these men were not architects, but master- workmen. 
But while the sketch-book proves that Villars designed and 
directed work by means of drawings, there is nothing to 
show that he worked with his own hands at the buildings ; 
while the plan which he gives us of a church, designed by 
himself and his friend, Peter de Corbie, seems as much 
individual work as any produced under the " false " system. 

These men, it is true, may have been engaged on only 
one cathedral at a time, But a cathedral, as then conceived, 
with its wealth of design, furnished ample work for the life- 
time of any man. It might, perhaps, be an improvement

employed in England during the Middle Ages, together with the churches which 
they erected. 



88 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

on our practice if we bad a greater number of competent men 
among wbom our great works migbt be distributed, so that 
one architect might give his whole time and thoughts to each. 
But this does not prove that architects should be superseded 
by workmen. Our difficulty is the system of building con- 
tracts, which compels the planning of the building to its 
minutest details, usually in haste, before it is commenced, 
and which makes after-revision and improvement difficult. 
And when we see the enormous number of buildings, 
sometimes designed by modern architects as, for example, 
the brothers Adam all over the three kingdoms, all 
full of invention, elegant, finished, and correct according 
to their own style, we are bound to admit that the fact of 
an architect designing a great number of buildings, does 
not prevent his doing good and original work, full of 
variety. The result, however, is harder to attain now than 
formerly, when all workmen were trained in the same style 
as the architect himself. 

The instance of the Cathedral of Gerona, in Spain, where, 
in 1320, an agreement was made with a French architect, 
Jacques de Favariis, to superintend the works, and to visit 
them six times a year, seems very like our modern practice. 
We have documentary evidence that the design of these 
buildings was in each case the production or, at least, 
under the control of an architect superintending every part 
of the work from the foundation to the furnishing. The 
structure of the buildings themselves proves it, from their 
unity of design, and from the admirable adjustment of the 
various parts a result which, in a new art rapidly de- 
veloping, and before its principles were settled, could not 
have been attained by any mere understanding among 
hosts of workmen. It might perhaps be possible in a fully- 
developed art, with established principles and traditional 
modes of work, as in fact happened in late Gothic art, the 
various trades, without an architect to direct them, working 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 89 

harmoniously enough together at the sort of buildings to 
which they were accustomed. But this system might fail, 
as Viollet-le-Duc shows it did, in the restoration of Kheims 
Cathedral after the fire in the reign of Louis XI., when the 
building and its architecture were strange to the workmen. 
I think, therefore, there is ground for believing, that, at 
the rise of Gothic architecture, buildings were designed by 
architects having much the same functions as those of the 
present day. 

It can be shown still more easily that the second part of 
Mr. Fergusson's statement, namely, that the so-called false 
system has prevailed throughout Europe since the Reforma- 
tion to the present day, is erroneous ; for the evidence of 
the contrary is everywhere round us. 

Architecture took a new start in the fifteenth century in 
Italy, in: the sixteenth in England. Gothic had solved 
its problems, had reached the limit of height in cathedrals, 
the limit of twisting stone in tracery windows, and of tracery 
decoration on the walls ; while in England it had stiffened 
into Perpendicular, and, for reasons, logically good, the 
pointed arch had been gradually flattened till it became a 
straight lintel. The art could go no farther. In a stagnant 
state of society it would have lingered on, degraded like 
modern Chinese pottery, but in the creative age of the 
Eenaissance it had lost its interest and was thrown aside 
like a sucked orange. 

In the state of Gothic at the time, it was impossible that 
an age which had found a new life in Classical literature 
and sculpture, could avoid adopting Classic architecture. 
But the Eenaissance architecture was not mere copying, 
as Mr. Fergusson seems to assert by his nick-name of 
" copying styles." The great palaces of Eome and Florence 
are original works, not copies of old Eomari remains. The 
age was fortunate in France, Germany, and England, not 



90 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

only in the possession of great original architects, but in 
the good sense to employ them instead of mere copyists 
and bunglers. Thus the new style became established as 
the style of Europe and of every country which adopted 
European civilisation. It soon came to be worked on 
the system of what Mr. Fergusson calls a true style, not 
by original architects, but by workmen following a tradi- 
tion. It mingled with such traditions of the old Gothic as 
remained in each country, each of which produced its own 
type of the new style ; and, notwithstanding the more 
frequent employment of architects during the last few years, 
it still remained the traditional style everywhere. Every 
workman has been apprenticed to it and understands it ; and 
in it builds without drawings, according to Mr. Fergusson's 
" true system," those houses which Englishmen who must 
live in them justly abuse. The style has, to borrow a 
term applied in ecclesiastical controversy to a true church, 
a note of a " true style ;" it is practised by workmen as 
by an instinct ; its productions can be reasoned about 
with the same certainty as those of the instincts of the 
lower animals ; and, like them, it sometimes produces 
curious results by being followed out in unsuitable circum- 
stances. I remember once seeing a row of houses in a 
street where the side wall of the last house overhung a 
wooded bank and commanded an extensive view. Reason 
would have put the windows in this wall, but the builder's 
instinct prompted him to make this house exactly like the 
others, and to make the wall blank like the other party- 
walls, with the chimneys in it. 

It would seem then from the history of the Gothic and 
Renaissance styles that it is law of progress in architecture 
that architects with the gift of originality, and whose 
names have consequently been remembered, design original 
buildings. The new fashion is imitated by the ordinary 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 91 

workman, and a traditional, or true style (if Mr. Fergusson 
prefers so to call it), is established, which continues de- 
veloping by constant changes, till a new " epoch-making " 
period of mental activity gives a chance to original minds 
to make a new start. The same thing happens in other 
arts. Our original painters, like the old masters, have each 
their school of followers. When railways were first started, 
original minds, like George Stephenson's, were needed to 
lay them out ; now any contractor, even any common 
workmen, can make them. Any fool now can go to America 
or make an egg stand on its end, though it needed a 
Columbus to do either for the first time. 

The late Gothic revival is an instance of the same thing. 
Piigin and others started it, and his works, though among 
the earliest, are still among the best, because they possess 
the originality of genius. The style has now become 
traditional, with established forms and modes of work, if 
not for houses, at least for churches ; not among workmen 
who, though they make abortive attempts in it, being still 
imbued with the degraded Classic traditions, have never 
understood it ; yet with architects who, except when they 
unite with bad taste a belief in their own originality, design 
fairly good Gothic churches. 

This is also true of the new fashion of so-called Queen 
Anne ; although those whom accident may have caused to 
be accounted its leaders may not be those who first started 
it. The London builder is adopting its features, with more 
chance of success than in Gothic, since it is the natural 
outcome of London materials and modes of work ; but it is 
to be feared that both he and the more ignorant architects, 
in attempting to avoid commonplace may run into vulga- 
rity, to keep clear of which, in this style, requires the 
constant restraint of good taste and refinement. 

We see, then, that in architecture, as in other arts, in 



92 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

times of which we have any record, we can trace the rise of 
new inventions and know the names of their authors, while 
in times of which the records are lost, the names of the 
poets and sculptors have perished equally with those of the 
inventors of new styles of architecture. The anonymity 
of the " true " styles of architecture is an accident of our 
ignorance, not inherent in the nature of the art, and forms 
no ground for distinction between it and other arts. 
Reasoning from what we know to have happened in 
historical times, we may be certain that the earlier improve- 
ments in architecture, great or small, were not made by 
common workmen or by the general sentiment of the 
community, but by individual inventors whom then, as now, 
the multitude copied and followed. If these old works of 
art express the feelings and genius of the race, it is because 
the race adopted them as the expression of their own 
thoughts, National poetry is the creation of individual 
poets, national music of individual composers, and national 
architecture of individual architects, and the patterns and 
colours which we admire in Eastern carpets, are the in- 
vention of some long dead and forgotten designer. These, 
each in his own art, impressed their thoughts onthenation, 
so that they became the expression of the national sentiment. 
Everywhere, and in all time, progress has been determined 
by the individual. Tennyson's soft music has infected all 
the youth of our age. Before him was Campbell, " blowing 
trumpets and beating drums." For a time all aspirants to 
poetry were Byronic. When we go far back in time, we 
must believe that there was same infection of personal 
influence and mood. 

Now, as in all time, individuals, however remarkable 
they may be, are, in a sense, the products of their age and 
country ; but there is no reason for thinking they were 
more so formerly than now. 

And architecture is necessarily a product of its time, 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 93 

and influenced by national movements rather than bv 
individuals, to a greater degree than an art such as poetry, 
for several reasons. For in the first place, in domestic 
work, it must suit itself to our life and habits ; and these do 
not readily change, even for the better, at the bidding of 
any single individual ; while, in its application to religions 
purposes, it is dependent on the prevailing religious senti- 
ment. The romantic revival in architecture was a sequence 
of the romantic spirit in literature and religion, and it will 
last as long as these. 

In the second place, originality has not the same chance 
of showing itself in architecture as in poetry. A poet 
produces his work notwithstanding that his audience is 
unfavourable ; and if, as in the case of Wordsworth and 
Tennyson, it is received at first with opposition and ridicule, 
if the work is genuine, time will give it currency and favour. 
But an architect's work must be approved before he is 
employed ; and in his case, as in the poet's, new ideas being 
strange, are received with opposition and dislike all the 
greater the better they are, and the higher they rise above 
the heads of the people. It is sad to think of the good 
buildings which have been lost to us from this cause. We 
wasted our gift of Pugin. We may see in his little church 
at Ramsgate, where he had his own way, and which seems 
almost to contain in itself the whole Gothic revival, what a 
wealth of architectural design he could have given us if we 
had had eyes to see and hearts to receive it. 

A third reason why architecture cannot be so dependent 
on individual originality as poetry or literature, is that a 
building cannot, like a poem, be the work of one man. No 
doubt, by full and careful drawings, one man can direct a 
work down to its minutest details, and in the present state 
of workmen's training, this is the only way to get it right. 
But in such a state of things architecture labours under 
enormous, difficulties. The men who are capable of doing 



94 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

this when, as at present, architecture has no settled rules, and 
they are left to their own innate taste and sense of right, 
are necessarily few, and they are the least likely to be 
employed. The public taste is ignorant and uninformed ; 
debased by a vulgar sensationalism to which the boasted 
freedom of Gothic has too readily lent itself. It is otherwise 
when the laws of art are settled, when they are universally 
diffused, learned as traditions of the trade by apprenticeship, 
and practised without difficulty by men who could never 
have invented them. Then the work of architects, sculptors, 
carvers, painters, furnishers, fits together naturally and 
without effort. If we ever get back to such a state, it will 
not be by a fortuitous concourse of common workmen, but 
by men who can conceive, see clearly, and work out new 
order and beauty. The hope of our architecture depends on 
our having men who can do this, and on our giving them 
the opportunity of doing it. But, as in Pugin's case, there 
is more chance of our having the men than of their being 
employed. 

We agree with Mr. Fergusson and the writer in the 
Quarterly, that the present unsettled state of architecture is 
a misfortune to the art. But the causes lie deeper than 
architects can control ; they cannot change the spirit of an 
age; they are but straws in the tide of opinion which, in 
more important matters than architecture, is in a state of 
flux and movement. 

But all the more on this account does it seem to me our 
duty to preserve, instead of destroying, such building tradi- 
tions as remain among workmen, to give new vigour and 
interest to a style still living, though commonplace and 
degraded, and to give beauty and refinement to forms which, 
left to uneducated builders for half a century, had become 
vulgarised, while the talent and refinement of the country 
were following the new cry after Grothic. 

This consideration is, I think, a good justification of 



CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 95 

the reaction towards the freer forms of Classic, which 
is now influencing our architecture, though its cause lies 
deeper. 

When the Reviewer says that the hope of English 
architecture lies in the working man working without the 
aid of architects, on the traditional system of the true 
styles, we answer, that we have had that condition for fifty 
years, and the result is our dismal suburbs of London 
builders' houses. It was not in this way, as we have seen, 
that architecture progressed in the past, and, as Bishop 
Butler says, there is no reason to believe that it will be 
otherwise in the future. 

There may be virtue in working with our hands. The 
digging and delving to which Mr. Ruskin has set some 
Oxford undergraduates may be wholesome moral training. 
Mr. Gladstone may find benefit in felling trees. Monks, 
old and modern, have believed in the virtue of manual 
labour. It might be well for everybody if the old custom 
of apprenticing every lad, however rich, to some hand- 
working trade still prevailed. But the discipline has been 
recommended for its moral rather than its intellectual 
benefits, and in architecture especially it is brains, not 
hands, that are wanted for designing; where a workman 
has them it is waste to keep him to manual labour. That 
architects, as well as poets, will be born among them is to 
be expected, and the instances which Mr. Fergusson and 
others give of common workmen designing great buildings 
in modern times are merely examples of this, riot of a 
return to his " true " system of architecture. The church 
at Mousta was a break in the current building tradition of 
Malta, a bad copy of the Pantheon (including the two 
modern towers which spoil it), cleverly carried out. That 
its designer, Anthony Gatt, got only fifteenpence a day is 
an accident similar to Milton's getting only ten pounds for 
' Paradise Lost.' Both ought to have got much more, but 



96 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

the best reward of both, as of every true artist, was their 
delight in doing the work. 

The Reviewer's instance of the Scott Monument at 
Edinburgh, designed by Kemp, originally a working car- 
penter, is still more unfortunate for his argument. Not 
without faults, for the worst of which the spoiling of its 
line at the top by the introduction by. the Committee, after 
his death, of a projecting gallery Kemp is not responsible, 
it is a true work of genius, striking in design and perfectly 
truthful in construction. But it is not a production of a 
true style, but something altogether new to Edinburgh. 
Neither is it an instance, as the Mousta Church may be, of 
the designer working at it with his own hands, for it is one 
of our few buildings which are wholly of mason work, 
Kemp, its architect, was by trade a carpenter (or wright, 
as he would call it), who probably never cut a stone in his 
life, but whose trade gave him the practice of making 
working drawings. He was, in fact, one of the sketching 
architects whom the writer condemns. One of his friends, 
beside whom I worked in the office at Edinburgh where I 
was apprenticed, told me that Kemp used to disappear for 
long periods, during which he went abroad, and, working 
at his trade sufficiently to support himself, employed himself 
in sketching the old buildings of continental towns. 

The talent for designing architecture, like that of making 
poetry, may be born in any rank. Bishops may have had 
it, and when the principles and practice of the art were 
commonly understood (as we may hope to have them again), 
they may have found no difficulty in carrying out their 
ideas ; though in the instance the Reviewer quotes, where 
the church tower fell down from having a bad foundation, 
it might have been better for the bishop if he had had a 
competent architect to consult. I see no reason why women 
should not have it. I have known some ladies excellent 
planners. One of our best artists in furniture and decora- 






CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 97 



tions is a lady. Lord Burlington, doubtless, was an archi- 
tect, though Colin Campbell, in his ' Vitruvius Britannicus,' 
inserts Burlington House as his own design. Builders may 
have it, and some large firms supply the want of it by 
keeping an architect on the establishment, though their 
designs often fail, not only through commonplaceness and 
poverty of invention, but in the management of lighting 
and in planning. It is within my experience that a builder, 
asked to do some work requiring design, has come to an 
architect to advise him. I think he showed more wisdom 
than his employers, and that we would have better archi- 
tecture if builders oftener did the same. 

To say that workmen only can produce good architecture 
is absurd and contrary to fact, and I do not believe they 
would thank us for pushing them into this position. I have 
had occasion to know something of them, and have found 
them mostly honest and sensible, perhaps with an over- 
veneration for acquirements in others which they did not 
themselves possess, with an interest and pride in their work 
and in the design they were helping to carry out, and 
conscious that, to produce better art than they were used 
to, they must work under guidance. I have heard a differ- 
ent account of them that they take no interest in their 
work, that all they care for is to get as big a wage and to 
do as little work as possible for it. Doubtless, this is partly 
true, arid the trades' union regulations seem framed to foster 
these feelings. But who first taught them to give as little 
and to get as much as they could ; that their only value was 
their market value; that it was all a question of hard 
bargain, in which considerations of sentiment or honour 
were out of place ? If, in dealing with men, political 
economy has dropped out humanity as a factor in the 
problem, it is not the teachers of its dreary gospel who 
should complain that the workmen have taken them at 
their word. 

VOL. i. H 



98 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

Working men would not appreciate being left to make 
designs themselves, or understand the writer's veneration for 
them. Hero worship has reason in it, but I can see none, 
nor would they, in his new worship of the working man. 

We have no directions, either from Mr. Fergusson or his 
supporter, as to the practical steps which the public should 
take to introduce the " true " system, of architecture. On 
one point I would desire information, namely, which of the 
numerous trades connected with house building bricklayer, 
plasterer, carpenter, plumber, bell-hanger, decorator, &amp;c. 
is to have the direction of the work ? Old buildings were 
not so complicated ; the other trades were subordinate to 
the mason ; but a mason nowadays would find himself very 
helpless in adjusting the requirements of a modern house. 
Our London builders' houses, though each merely a repeti- 
tion of what has been done a thousand times, do not give 
hope for the system of leaving workmen to their own 
devices. It is, indeed, a curious theory that knowledge, 
education, and refinement should be hurtful to an art, to 
the proper practice of which, in the present day especially, 
they are essential. Because architecture, in a wholly differ- 
ent state of society when good art was traditional, was 
practised successfully by men who could neither read nor 
write, there is no reason to infer that the right w r ay to 
advance it now is to leave it in the hands of ignorant men. 
If our architecture be in the deplorable state which is 
asserted, it needs to raise it not ignorant men, but men who 
unite the faculty of original design to education, refinement, 
and special training for the work. 

But, it may be said, have we not precisely such a class 
in the architectural profession? Why, then, is our 
architecture a failure ? Why are so many bad and unin- 
teresting buildings now erected? Why does our architecture 
alternate between mean commonplace and forced striving 
for effect ? 



CONDITIONS OP PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 99 

Several answers may be given. It may be said that our 
rstem has failed, because the architectural profession has 
not, on the whole, possessed the necessary requirements for 
their work. 

Or it may be said that our system has not failed ; that 
our architecture is in a very satisfactory state ; that the 
recent criticisms are false ; and that if the public are dis- 
satisfied with us, as we are told, it only shows their 
ignorance and unreasonableness. I do not think it would 
be wise for architects to rest content in such assurance. 
It would riot tend to restore the confidence of the public in 
them ; and, indeed, none of them believe it, for though each 
may consider his own works excellent, he thinks other new 
works faulty, and far inferior to old ones. Architects 
should remember that, unlike painters and authors, they 
have hitherto almost escaped public criticism. Those who 
had the necessary knowledge felt they could not with 
propriety criticise unfavourably the work of professional 
rivals^ and amateur criticism was generally valueless from 
ignorance. 

A great deal of the architecture produced is, it must be 
confessed, very bad. In Grothic, the plainer buildings look 
poor and raw ; the more expensive are overloaded with 
ornaments and pillars and tracery not called for by use or 
construction, or are hacked with wild ugly coarse notchings, 
as if attempting to look barbarous; while our Classic buildings 
generally want the finish and refinement which character- 
ised those of the last age when the style was better under- 
stood. Nor do I believe that those who come after us will 
thank us for our restorations, which, conducted apparently 
on the principle that the memorials of Tudor times arid of 
the Church of England since the Reformation are of no value 
and are even abominations, have destroyed the interest 
attaching to so many of our churches as continuous records 
of successive generations ; have altered buildings which have 

H 2 



100 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

been landmarks for centuries ; have substituted for the 
memories of the past the meddling of an architect ; for 
the grey tone of age, Kent rag with black pointing, bad 
stained glass, and Miriton's tiles. If the few churches still 
Untouched are left alone, and merely kept in repair, they 
will be the most interesting in England, well worth a 
pilgrimage. The destruction of historical records, which 
the restoration mania has achieved, is due, however, less to 
architects than to the zeal of the clergy, whom architects 
have often prevented from perpetrating some favourite 
vandalism. 

While maintaining, then, that the views of Mr. Fergusson 
and the ' Quarterly Review' as to the mode in which architec- 
ture should be conducted, are impracticable, I must admit 
that they are right in declaring the state of English archi- 
tecture unsatisfactory. What are the causes ? By discover- 
ing them we shall best know where to look for the remedy. 

There is not less zeal or talent, less knowledge or 
enthusiasm in those who practise architecture now than in 
old times. Architects do fair work for their pay, quite as 
much as engineers, surveyors, or stock-brokers, or even 
painters or sculptors, and they are, I believe, as competent 
at their work as other artists or authors. Consider, 
however, the conditions under which architecture is prac- 
tised. There is probably as large a proportion of bad poetry 
and bad literature produced as of bad architecture. But 
the bad books get buried in library shelves, or, reduced 
again to pulp and made into clean paper, they cease to 
trouble us. Only the selected books which have stood 
the test of time remain, and from them our literature is 
judged. Our painting we judge of by the pictures selected 
for exhibitions, and happily never see the thousands rejected. 
But no such selection is possible among buildings ; the bad 
ones, equally with the good, continue to force themselves on 
our notice, like vulgar tunes on a street grind-organ. And 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 101 

as our taste like our manners is formed by our surround- 
ings, the evil tends to perpetuate itself, and every bad 
building breeds more by corrupting the public taste. If the 
art were in the condition it ought to be no bad buildings 
at all should be produced. But the architect is exposed to 
the same risk of error as one finding his way through a 
pathless forest instead of along a beaten track. As we 
cannot get rid of his productions, the freedom and indi- 
vidualism, which is a characteristic of our modern archi- 
tecture, is a far greater evil in it than in the other arts 
and in literature. 

Under the old system of architecture, when there was an 
established style and manner of work, there was not the 
same risk of individual error ; for, living in the age, they 
could not help learning the style. Just as in social inter- 
course those who are brought up in refined society acquire, 
unconsciously, good manners. Some men have a power 
of forming them for themselves. Carlyle says of Robert 
Burns, when he came straight from the plough into the 
society of Edinburgh, that high duchesses were charmed 
with the manners of the man ; and what are good manners, 
he asks, but the rules and refinements of intercourse, which 
such men have invented for us. Without such an inheritance 
of traditional manners, instilled into us from infancy so that 
it becomes a part of ourselves, most men would have bad 
manners or no manners at all ; but by the training of good 
society, men who are naturally boors, may acquire and 
practice a real refinement. 

In architecture, as in every profession, there are in- 
competent men without any natural gift for it. Apprenticed 
to it young, before they know their own minds, they do not 
care for it, but are unable to leave it : sometimes they even 
come to believe in their own powers of design, and measure 
the merit of their works by the uphill labour it has cost 
them to produce them. Others have a power of composing 



102 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

bad things and of expressing their own vulgarity in their 
architecture. 

In architecture, under the old system, these men were 
harmless. The first, instead of the inanities he now per- 
petrates, reproduced the traditions he had learned, the 
second was restrained in his vulgarity by the rules of the 
prevailing style. And when that style, which was charac- 
teristic of the time, was understood by every one, architects 
who did not understand it had little chance of employment. 

Employers judge by those things which they understand, 
not by art considerations, for which they care nothing. 
The architect makes a design good enough to please them, 
or, perhaps, commits the matter to some clerk who, from 
want of connection or lack of business pushing, has failed to 
get jobs of his own. In the latter case, the result may be 
satisfactory if the clerk can design, and is not thwarted by 
the architect's or his employer's bad taste. But it would 
probably be better for the art if those who could themselves 
design had the responsibility of carrying out the buildings. 
They are quite as likely to be honest as the mere business 
man, and as competent for carrying on the work ; for the 
old notion that poets and artists generally are imbeciles in 
business matters has not been found to accord with fact. 
Seeing then that individual talent and power of design is 
so much more important in the present condition of architec- 
ture than in old times, the greatest good which could befall 
the art would be that those who have such powers should 
get the opportunity of exercising them. 

If architects would advise pupils, who show no capacity 
or liking for the art, to give up the profession, the number 
of bad buildings would be sensibly diminished; and the 
pupils' lives would be happier by their taking to some 
pursuit they cared for, before it was too late. The thing 
to be desired is to utilise the designing power that is 
born in the country. Any mechanical obstructions which 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 103 

hinder this are an injury to an art, the practice of which 
should be as free as that of literature or painting. 

No natural talent for design, however, will be of much, 
practical value without training, and for this there is 
nothing better than the old system of apprenticeship. We 
might, however, do something more than we do to secure 
that those who are to practise the art are taught the 
principles which the experience of mankind has discovered 
and established. We cannot give the power of original 
design to those who do not naturally possess it, but we 
might help to establish a standard of taste which would 
keep those who have no natural ability from common 
blunders. 

There is some truth in the Reviewer's assertion that 
the training of architects is too much at the desk among 
drawings, and too little among actual buildings. Instead 
of thinking out his buildings in brick and stone, and using 
drawings as mere directions to workmen, he comes to look 
on the making of drawings as the aim of the art, and un- 
consciously thinks of building materials merely as a means 
of imitating, as nearly as they are capable of, the effect he 
has realised in the drawing. Where the design requires a 
break he puts a half-brick projection, or a rain-water pipe, 
which make quite a strong line in the drawing, but are 
nothing in the actual building. 

Old buildings appear strange and wrong when drawn out 
accurately in elevation. Indeed, they must do so if they 
look right in execution. There is a story of an architect 
who lately restored an old church, and on being appealed to 
by a well-known artist in the neighbourhood to spare the 
quaint old tower, answered that it was true it looked well 
in the landscape, but that if the artist would glance at an 
accurate elevation of it he had made at his office he would 
see what a ridiculous-looking thing it was. So the old 
tower is now replaced by a very commonplace one, too 



104 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



weak to ring the bells in ; which, however, probably looks 
well in drawing. 

ATI architect sometimes deceives his employers and him- 
self by making pretty effects in his drawings which he 
cannot build. He is wise in his generation, for it is by the 
drawing he is judged, and the execution of the work deter- 
mined on. We wonder often what can be the meaning of 
curious features in modern buildings, till we perceive that 
they are abortive attempts to imitate, in unsuitable mate- 
rials, some effect of cross-hatching. A reflection from some 
irregular patches of glazed tiles on a wall we discover, on 
examination, to be the only parts spared by London dirt of 
an elaborate design of wall decoration, which must have 
been the most conspicuous feature of the hatched drawing. 
A dirty bullet sticking out on a wall was doubtless con- 
ceived and drawn as a polished marble ball, giving a bright 
point of light, and a long dark shadow on the wall. Or a 
church, which in the drawing looked like a cathedral, turns 
out, when built, like a toy church. There has been a 
mistake in scale you can put your hand on the top of the 
nave piers. 

The power of producing clever effects in cross-hatching is 
therefore sometimes a snare to an architect. All that he 
wants with drawing is accurately to convey his orders to 
the workmen. This is all the Middle Age builders seem to 
have had. Inigo Jones' perspectives are very washed-out 
and feeble-looking productions. Working drawings may 
give no more idea of the finished building than a score of 
music of the tune. 

An architect, besides knowing his own profession, may 
be skilled in painting or cross-hatching, as he may be able 
to model in clay or play on the German flute. But these 
are different faculties, and it is as unreasonable to require it 
as a proof of an architect's competence in his own art, or as 
a condition in exhibited drawings that they should be done 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 105 

by the architect's own hand as it was stated the Eoyal 
Academy proposed to do as to judge a sculptor's skill by 
his capacity for copying his own statues in oil or water- 
colour drawings. The picture of a building or a statue will 
be best done by an artist whose natural mode of expression 
is in drawing, not in stone and lime or clay and marble. 

To hope, however, that architects should be judged by 
their power of producing good architecture, and should get 
according to their capacity for doing it, would be to 

:pect too much from ordinary common sense. We might 
tope for improvement in our architecture if there were 
lore general training in the art, and a better knowledge 
of it such as a general interest in it would bring. It is 
becoming a subject of interest to educated men, who are 
eager to understand it if the confusion and the uncertainty 
of its principles would admit. 

For exciting this interest and inspiring a belief in the 
reality of art and the duty of following it with truth and 
earnestness we owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Buskin ; and 
if, from the occasional impracticableness of his advice or 
from ignorant attempts to carry it out, confusion and bad 
art have been too often the immediate result, investigation 
and discussion may in time clear away these errors, arid 
give the impetus a true direction. 

Without an appreciation of the value of the art for its 
own sake, and some real knowledge of it in the community, 
we cannot hope to see much good architecture. Until this 
comes about, architects will be selected for the qualities 
which their employers can understand energy and business 
habits, the faculty of writing good letters, plausibility and 
pleasing manners, and especially that power of inspiring 
confidence which makes employers feel themselves safe in 
following their advice and intrusting their purses in their 
hands, and skill in getting work to do, which by no means 
implies the power of doing it. Such faculties would find a 






106 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

more legitimate sphere in an agency for a life insurance 
company, in pushing some new arcticle of commerce, or in 
building and contracting rather than in art. In old times 
the architect had nothing to do with the business arrange- 
ments, he simply gave the designs and superintended the 
work. This was possible, when the work was done not by 
contract but by day's wages ; and the system had the addi- 
tional advantage of permitting improvements in the design 
as the building was going on, evidences of which we find in 
all old work. This is generally impracticable now ; but 
unquestionably we increase the difficulty of getting good 
art by our system, which compels an architect, besides (or 
instead of) being an artist, to be a sharp business man, and 
selects him generally on that account. No doubt it is so in 
other professions. Skill is presumed in doctors from their 
having a carriage, or from a judicious manner, but to a 
great extent the judgment of their own profession tends to 
keep their reputation at its true level. 

In painting, happily for it, the decision as to merit lies 
with brother artists. A committee of painters decides what 
pictures the English public shall be allowed to see, and 
apportions their merits by their places on the walls ; but 
in architecture judgment by the profession of each other's 
productions is impossible, partly because, since an architect 
will undertake any amount of work, you may as well give 
him the job as consult him as to rival architects ; but still 
more, because from the variety of styles the art has no 
recognised principles or standards of excellence. 

It is governed, consequently, by amateur criticism, which 
too readily recognises surface merits. Every one thinks 
himself a critic in architecture with as good a right to his 
opinion as anybody else ; especially if he has travelled on the 
Continent, arid knows the meaning of words like " distylar 
in antis," or " sexparite vaulting." In music or painting, 
those who know nothing are modest, and frankly confess that 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 107 

they do not pretend to be judges ; for there is a chance 
they may be set down by some one who is an authority, or 
by a reference to principles ; but in architecture, at present, 
there are no authorities and no principles, so that a town, 
councillor or vestryman considers himself a judge. 

Nor, though the principles of composition in sculpture 
painting and architecture are essentially the same, is a 
painter necessarily a judge of architecture unless he knows 
its technical difficulties; just as a good critic in painting 
or etching, though he may not have mastered it, should 
have tried it, to know when difficulties have been overcome, 
and to appreciate the merit of what may look quite simple. 
Do these arts, then, exist only for experts? By no means, 
but no one can form a true judgment on them who cannot 
see, beneath their surface, truth which lies deeper and will 
last, and which the ignorant who do not see it at once 
may in time come to appreciate. 

When the public do not resign themselves into the hands 
of an architect, but judge the productions of his art by their 
own ideas of merit, as burial boards and chapel committees 
attempt in competitions, they are sure to select the most 
striking and flashy design as clever and original, while 
those which are quiet and unobtrusive, whose beauty has 
that strangeness which Bacon says all lasting beauty has at 
first, are passed over. The ignorant prefer paintings crude 
in colour to those toned into quiet harmony, and popular 
airs to classical music. Fortunately they soon tire of the 
popular air and discard it, and they tire also of the build- 
hjg which pleased them so much, but unhappily they 
cannot pull it down. It must remain corrupting the public 
taste through generations. Hence no architect who has 
much self-respect will engage in a competition, unless either 
he has friends in the committee who believe in him, or 
the decision is referred to some one who understands the 
subject. Usually, however, the selection of the architect is 



108 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



made, as in other professions, from his reputation, with the 
same result as at the bar, of heaping so much work on a 
few, that even with great ability and hard work they 
cannot get through it without scamping. To make an 
architectural reputation, very little art, and that rather of 
an obvious kind, will suffice ; practical qualities and the 
faculty of getting work are of more avail than the power 
of doing it. A better knowledge of the art by the public 
might give us some hope of better architecture. What 
would give most hope would be for a country to return, if 
it be possible, to a single style. There would then be some 
chance of the art being generally understood. The attempts 
of architects would not, as at present, so far outrun their 
knowledge, and builders and workmen might possibly again 
put good art unconsciously into their ordinary work. 

During the last half century, since the Gothic revival 
commenced, the difficulties of architecture have been 
aggravated, by several different styles being practised at the 
same time. It is like trying to speak three or four different 
languages. Some men may express themselves correctly in 
all, but the chances are in favour of bad grammar and 
composition, and of a want of that mastery of the refine- 
ments of language which makes the charm of good writing. 
We have it is true in numberless books accurate records of 
all the styles we practise at the time when they were 
universally current and understood by which to form our 
taste, but their quantity overpowers us ; it is more than we 
can digest. Our buildings, therefore, are apt to be made 
up of scraps of design badly put together. We cling 
slavishly to precedent as our only security from error, 
instead of the style being a part of ourselves and our 
natural mode of expression. 

Allowing an enormous admission that architects could 
master all the different styles they practise, or supposing 
that each architect only attempted one, yet the tradesman 



CONDITIONS OP PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 109 

who comes across a new one at every new job has to 
acquire fresh habits and modes of work, and, being taught 
that his last methods in which he has been working are 
wrong, gets a medley of them all into his head, which makes 
it impossible for him ever to work correctly by himself in 
any style again. As most of the ordinary building of the 
country is done by tradesmen without the direction of 
architects, the degradation of the art thus caused is serious. 
The Gothic movement has now spread from the architects 
to the builders ; villas made to sell and streets of small 
suburban houses are being built everywhere in a style 
meant to be Gothic, but with none of the characteristics 
which made old Gothic beautiful, with only some of its 
features, rendered absurd by the way they are used, like 
the spurs and swallow-tailed coat which constituted the 
whole of the King of Tahiti's court dress. 

Nor do the evil effects to the workman end here. The 
characteristics of style must descend to the minutest 
particulars to obtain work with refinement and harmony 
in it. Thus the workman has lost the power the old work- 
man had of doing good work without an architect ; the 
architect must furnish drawings for everything. The result 
is as hurtful to the work as to the workman. No doubt 
we may obtain harmony and correctness by drawings, but 
only at the expense of interest and life. We lose what 
gives the main charm to old Gothic buildings, and to old 
Greek and Roman ones also the impression on them of the 
thought of a number of different minds working to one 
end. Not that there is always a great variety of ideas in 
these old buildings the same ornaments are repeated a 
hundred times but, instead of as now being a lifeless copy 
from a drawing, they are the expression of what had 
become part of the workman's nature, and have in them 
something of his life. He understood it so well that he 
could give it variety and interest without losing its meaning 



110 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

and idea. And if he had originality there was full free- 
dom for the exercise of it. In these old Gothic buildings 
the portals are crowded with saints, each under a canopy 
typifying the new Jerusalem. Imagination ran wild in the 
oak carving of the benches, and in the grotesques into 
which the gargoyles, or stone water-spouts, were formed 
(the action suited usually to their purpose in the building of 
spewing water from their mouths). They were vulgar and 
coarse no doubt sometimes, but full of human interest ; for 
they expressed the minds and feelings of the carvers. And 
this variety was obtained without the risk of losing 
harmony, for only one style was known at the time in 
which they could express themselves. 

In old Greek architecture there is the same individual 
life, not only in the higher sculpture, but in the repeated 
ornament; less wild, it is true, more under subjection to 
law, but as different from the frozen regularity of our 
imitation of it, as the leaves of a tree are from stamped- 
leather ornaments. Each egg and dart is different from its 
neighbour, each leaf has its own individual grace. And 
so on old Greek vases the painting is as free as in any 
Gothic work, not the stiff perfect thing we should imagine 
from our copies of them. This power in the workman of 
carrying out a design correctly in detail has only been lost 
in our own day. Till the Gothic revival in the last century 
he had his one style, which, though it might be dull and 
unimaginative, he understood and could work in without 
fear of going wrong. Now working one day at a Classic 
building, the next at a Gothic one, his ideas are a confused 
jumble, and he is unable to do anything of himself in the 
smallest details without guidance. A church in Glasgow 
of last century is a curious proof of this. It is a copy of 
St. Martin's-in-the-Fields in London, from Gibbs' published 
design, by a local carpenter, whose traditional knowledge 
enabled him to carry out the style creditably in detail. 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. Ill 

The result is a correct though somewhat dull piece of 
architecture. It would have been better if Gribbs had him- 
self carried it out, but as a large proportion of the buildings 
of the country have been and will continue to be carried 
out by builders, and as, they are sure, if not as in this case 
actually to copy an architect's building, at least to follow 
the fashion set them by architects, it would be an advantage 
if both the builder and architect worked in the same style 
so that the builder might copy with understanding. 

Another evil resulting from the variety of styles leaving 
the workman without any of his own is the increased 
expense of producing work with any artistic character. 
Formerly he put art into what he did unconsciously, carrying 
out the traditions in which he had been trained. It was to 
him the easiest and consequently the cheapest way. But 
it takes far more time carefully to follow a drawing, and in 
doing so he is always making mistakes : each new design is 
like a new training ; he never gets his hand in. Hence 
the simplest and cheapest-looking piece of furniture from 
an architect's design costs more than an elaborate one 
in a style the workman is used to, even leaving out of 
account the remuneration of the architect. 

In the mere architecture of our houses (in the limited sense 
in which we usually employ the term as finished with the 
plaster-work) we manage, by reducing it to its simplest ex- 
pression, abstracting from it its life and spontaneity and not 
trusting ourselves except in copying old ideas, to have 
everything pretty well in keeping in whatever style we 
work. But it is impossible, without an expenditure of time 
and money such as few can afford, to carry the same har- 
mony throughout the furniture and decorations, and without 
this the house does not attempt to be a work of art. For 
we are dependent on a host of different manufacturers for 
carpets, paper-hangings, upholstery, chairs, tables, grates, 
lamps, crockery, and the thousand and one things which 



112 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

make up the furnishing of a house ; and it is impossible that 
these can be produced in variety sufficient to give a reason- 
able choice in all the different styles we follow, especially 
as what we can buy in shops is mostly bad in taste. 

The only resource is to have everything made from special 
designs, which is only rarely practicable and does not 
necessarily guarantee success. Architects' designs may give 
us something like harmony and a relief from modern up- 
holsterers' work in the last dregs of Louis Quatorze taste 
with all its absurdity of illogical construction and none of 
the grace which was its merit ; but they often, at least in 
their first attempts, miss the first requisites of practicalness 
and comfort. Chairs are so heavy that it takes two people 
to lift them, or the carving and ornament, which looks 
simple on paper, takes weeks of work, and does not tell 
when executed. French architects, who are accustomed to 
design the furniture for their houses, do not fall into these 
errors; and I have known British upholsterers get a 
reputation for taste, and live for years on copying two or 
three chairs from French architects' designs that they had 
picked up. 

This harmony throughout, essential to a finished work of 
art, has been attained in the building which, in spite of all 
that has been said against it, is the most complete specimen 
of the Gothic revival the new Houses of Parliament. 

Sir Charles Barry's good taste could endure nothing out 
of harmony, and from the bridge and terrace outside, the 
architecture, carving, furniture, hangings, and stained glass, 
down to the knives and spoons in the dining-room, and the 
ash-holders in the smoking-room, everything is in the same 
style. But it needed all his learning and correctness and 
power of designing, with Pugin's marvellous faculty of 
inventing ornament, working continuously at it for about 
twenty years, to produce the result. What was done would 
have been impossible, without practically unlimited draft 



CONDITIONS OP PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 113 



on the nation's purse. Yet it is not perfect; notwith- 
standing that a special army of workmen were trained for 
it, there is a certain correctness and sameness in the carving 
very different from the living irregularity that gives its 
charm to old work ; the higher decoration of painting and 
sculpture could not be brought under the influence of the 
style, and is out of keeping and out of harmony. 

If there was failure here, who can hope to succeed ? The 
results of having no style of our own at present in architec- 
ture are that, as a general rule, architects cannot understand 
their art, and builders, who do most of the actual work, 
can have no hope of doing so, that the public generally 
are equally ignorant, that the workman is degraded into a 
machine, that harmony in the furnishing is impossible, 
arid that the work is bad. 

"If there be any condition," says Mr. Euskin, "which in 
watching the progress of architecture, we see distinct and 
general, . . . any one conclusion which may be constantly 
drawn, it is this, that the architecture of a nation is great 
only when it is as universal and established as its language, 
and when provincial differences of style are nothing more 
than so many dialects. . . . Other necessities are matters 
of doubt. Nations have been alike successful in their 
architecture in times of poverty and of wealth, in times of 
barbarism and refinement ; . . . but this one condition has 
been constant, this one requirement clear, in all places and 
at all times, that the work shall be that of a school, that no 
individual caprice shall dispense with, or materially vary, 
accepted types and customary decorations ; that from the 
cottage to the palace, and from the chapel to the basilica, . . . 
every member and feature of the architecture of the nation 
shall be as commonly current, as frankly accepted, as 
its language or its coin. . . . We want no new style of 
architecture. . . . But we must have some style. It is of 
marvellously little importance, if we have a code of laws, 

VOL. I. I 



114 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

and they be good laws, whether they be new or old, foreign 
or native, Eoman or Saxon, or Norman or English laws ; 
but it is of considerable importance that we should have 
a code of laws of one kind or another, and that code accepted 
and enforced from one side of the island to another, and not 
one law made ground of judgment at York, and another at 
Exeter." * " I think all the arts will languish until architec- 
ture takes the lead, and (this I don't think, I proclaim as 
confidently as I would assert the necessity, for the safety of 
society, of an understood and strongly administered legal 
government) our architecture will languish, and that in 
the very dust, until the first principle of common sense be 
manfully obeyed, and a universal system of form and work- 
manship be everywhere adopted and enforced. It may be 
said that this is impossible. It may be so I fear it is so : 
I have nothing to do with the impossibility of it ; I simply 
know and assert the necessity of it. If it be impossible, 
English art is impossible. Give it up at once. You are 
wasting time and money and energy on it, and though you 
exhaust centuries and treasuries, and break hearts for it, you 
will never raise it above the merest dilettanteisra. Think not 
of it. It is a dangerous vanity, a mere gulf in which genius 
after genius will be swallowed up, and it will not close. 
And so it will continue to be unless the one bold and 
broad step be taken at the beginning. We shall not 
manufacture art out of pottery and printed stuffs ; we 
shall not reason art out by our philosophy ; we shall not 
stumble upon art by our experiments, nor create it by our 
fancies : I do not say we can even build it out of brick am 
stone ; but there is a chance for us in these, and there is 
in none else ; and that chance rests on the bare possibility 
of obtaining the consent, both of architects and of the 
public, to choose a style, and to use it universally." 2

But what style are we to choose ? It is now that the 
real difficulty begins, for it is the difference of opinion on 
this point, among men whose knowledge gives them a right 
to have one, which is one main cause of the existing 
confusion. 

" Why not do without a style at all?" is one of the most 
obvious and most frequently suggested answers ; " build 
simply as our wants demand, and never mind style." This 
is precisely what we do to a melancholy extent in those 
new manufacturing towns, utterly devoid of grace or beauty 
or interest, though even in these dismal heaps of bricks and 
slates there are still some traces of old style or methods 
of work. Happily we cannot rest satisfied in this return to 
barbarism. Then "let us be original, and make a new 
style for ourselves." It would be about as wise to say, 
" Let us invent a new language." At the shortest, the pro- 
cess takes a century or two, even when it is only a change 
or development of an older one. 

There is an appearance of reason in imagining that we 
might add to what we build for practical need some of the 
qualities of beauty or grandeur enumerated in the last 
chapter. But the progress of art ideas is inconceivably 
slow. We have still in daily use forms of ornament 
invented thousands of years ago ; and why not, if they suit' 
our purposeand , are better than we can invent ourselves ? 

The problems involved in clothing the necessities of house- 
construction in artistic forms have already been solved for 
us, with a perfection of art from the accumulated thought of 
centuries, compared with which any new attempts of ours 
would be mere crudities. We need no new forms of 
windows. For spanning spaces we cannot improve on the 
arch and lintel ; and any new form of mouldings we might 
invent would most likely only be variations for the worse 
from what we find ready to our hands. If we could divest 
ourselves of our civilisation, of our power of construction 

I 2

and sense of beauty, we might, like the early Mediaeval 
builders, begin at the beginning again (though their 
attempts, too, were copies of Roman buildings, but so bad 
as to be original), and start the art anew on a fresh course. 
But our knowledge of the purity and refinement of Greek 
art, the nerve and poetry of Gothic, and the sumptuousness 
of Roman and Renaissance, gives us ideas which we can 
satisfy only by appropriating forms already perfected. 

Consequently we must continue to copy ; our architecture 
must be founded on some old style. 

In this way former architectures have grown. Greece 
got the first ideas of her art from Egypt and from Asia ; 
Indian architecture is derived from Greek ; Romanesque, 
Gothic, and Byzantine, from Roman. Copying is riot 
necessarily an evil, if only we compel ourselves to vary 
from the standard when necessity requires. But it is not 
easy to clothe such new requirements with the same beauty 
as the old ; we are apt either to sacrifice our convenience to 
the style, or to retain features which are useless, for their 
beauty. If we can master some old style, so that we can 
use it in spirit rather than in form, and can give artistic 
expression to our new necessities in harmony with it, we 
may hope in time to have a style of our own. 

We must found on some old style, which shall we 
choose ? It is now that the real difficulty begins. 

Mr. Fergusson, after describing and criticising the new 
Federal Palace at Berne, a building in a round-arched 
massive style with something of the character of Florentine 
palaces, and contrasting it with our Houses of Parliament, 
concludes : " A few years hence, few probably will dispute 
that a simpler, a more massive, and more modern style, 
would have been better suited for our Parliament Houses 
than the one adopted ; whether it ought to be the one the 
Swiss have employed is a question not so easily answered. 
It seems, however, clear that they are nearer the truth than 



CONDITIONS OF PRODUCING GOOD ARCHITECTURE. 117 

ourselves ; and with some modifications, their style might 
be so adapted as to make it approach more nearly to what 
is really right and truthful than anything we have yet seen 
in modern times." x 

On the other hand, Mr. Ruskin says : " I have said that it 
was immaterial what style was adopted, so far as regards 
the room for originality which its development would 
admit. It is not so, however, when we take into considera- 
tion the far more important questions of the facility of 
adaptation to general purposes, and of the sympathy with 
which this or that style would be popularly regarded. The 
choice of Classical or Gothic, again using the latter term in 
its broadest sense, may be questionable when it regards 
some single and considerable public building ; but I cannot 
conceive it questionable, for an instant, when it regards 
modern uses in general; I cannot conceive any architect 
insane enough to project the vulgarisation of Greek archi- 
tecture. Neither can it be rationally questionable whether 
we should adopt Early or Late, Original or Derivative 
Gothic. If the latter were chosen, it must be either some 
impotent and ugly degradation, like our own Tudor, or else 
a style whose grammatical laws it would be nearly impossible 
to limit or arrange, like the French Flamboyant. We are 
equally precluded from adopting styles essentially infantine 
or barbarous, however Herculean in their infancy, or 
majestic in their outlawry, such as our own Norman or the 
Lombard Romanesque. The choice would lie, I think, 
between four styles: 1. The Pisan Romanesque. 2. The 
Early Gothic of the Western Italian Republics, advanced so 
far and as fast as our art would enable us to the Gothic of 
Giotto. 3. The Venetian Gothic in its purest development. 
4. The English earliest Decorated. The most natural, 
perhaps the safest choice, would be the last, well fenced 
from chance of again stiffening into the Perpendicular ; and

perhaps enriched by some mingling of decorative elements 
from the exquisite decorated Gothic of France, of which in 
such cases it would be needful to accept some well-known 
examples, as the north door of Rouen and the Church of 
St. Urban' s at Troyes, for final and limiting authorities on 
the side of decoration." 

These views as to the style we should adopt are suffi- 
ciently antagonistic, and counsel and practice might be 
quoted recommending others. The fact that there should 
be any question as to the style we ought to adopt is in 
itself an absurdity, parallel to that of the French Consti- 
tution-mongers, who persuaded themselves that the estab- 
lishment of monarchy or republic was to be determined 
on the ground of the theoretical excellence and logical 
symmetry of either system. 

Clearly the question cannot be settled in Mr. Ruskin's off- 
hand way, by the mere expression of individual opinion and 
liking. It is doubtful if any settlement is possible, any 
more than if we attempted at this moment to fix the views 
of the age on religion and philosophy. If it be possible, 
such a settlement will be determined not by intrinsic merit, 
but by the simple consideration whether any one style has 
a chance of being generally adopted. The advantages oi 
adopting one and sticking to it would be so great that il 
is at least worth while making the inquiry.

WHAT STYLE MOST SUITABLE. HO 



CHAPTER IV. 



WHAT STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE IS MOST SUITABLE FOR OUR 

HOUSES ? 



IN the last chapter some of the inconveniences were 
pointed out which arise from practising various styles of 
architecture at the same time, such as the impossibility 
of so many styles being understood either by architects 
or by the public, and their consequent faultiness and 
imperfection ; the waste of time and energy in teaching 
workmen various ways of doing their work, and the im- 
possibility of their learning any style so thoroughly as 
to work without the direction of one who has studied old 
styles, with the consequence of bad and ignorant work 
when they are left alone (as in the great mass of common 
building throughout the country must be the case) ; and 
of spiritless accuracy, instead of the charm of intelligent 
spontaneity when they are directed by an architect ; and, 
in domestic architecture especially, the difficulty and great 
expense of carrying any style consistently throughout* the 
whole decorations and furnishings of a house, consequent on 
the necessity of getting every article specially made from 



120 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

special designs. So that it is only in the most expensive 
houses, and but rarely in these, that there is the harmony 
essential to a work of art. 

But is it possible for us to confine ourselves to one style ? 
Certainly no imperial enactment could make us do so, much 
less any counsels or persuasions in books. 

There are probably too many opposing modes of thought 
at present for one style to be a suitable expression of them 
all. Neither the social conditions nor the philosophy are 
yet born which can bring unity into thought and into art. 
Nor can we delay building our houses and cities till this 
happens. 

All the styles of the world are open for us to choose from. 
They have all been studied, and we know something about 
each. We have even built Chinese pagodas. Egyptian has 
been attempted (in plaster) and Byzantine has its advocates. 
We must go on building with good architecture or with bad 
as we can get it, and each one will, as at present, adopt 
whatever style his inclinations or those of his architect 
dictate. It is also to be feared that the desire which 
characterises our time for constant change and new fashions 
may prevent us from continuing any style long enough to 
let it fix its roots and grow naturally. 

But an approach to unity of opinion and practice may 
helped by an examination of the different styles possible foi 
us with the view of determining which of them is, on th&lt; 
whole, the most suitable for our houses. A knowledge oi 
what is possible in our circumstances may at least do som( 
thing to prevent us spending thought and energy anc 
money uselessly in devious courses on isolated attempt 
which can have no permanent influence on our genen 
architecture. 

There are several practical limits to our freedom of choi&lt; 

In the first place, as unity of style in our architecture 
is the object we are aiming at that we may have SOUK 



WHAT STYLE MOST SUITABLE. 121 

single one which might be generally adopted, the style we 
.fix on should not be strange and unfamiliar, but should 
be intelligible to builders and workmen and to ordinary 
people, otherwise its productions will not be good in point 
of architecture, or, if they are, their merits will not be 
understood. 

The style we adopt should utilise the traditional habits 
and modes of work in which workmen of all trades have 
been trained ; it should not compel them to learn new ones, 
which would require a new apprenticeship. 

It should adopt the ordinary modes of construction 
familiar in the building trades, provided they are not 
vicious or bad. 

It should express our present civilisation, our modern 
feelings and ways of thinking. This does not necessarily 
preclude the adoption of some old style of architecture. 

Accurate mechanical finish is a characteristic of English 
work and by many is looked on as fine art. Though it is 
not so, it has its value and should be a characteristic of 
our style. 

We ought to be able to get furniture and fittings 
manufactured in the usual way by ordinary workmen, if 
not exactly of the usual designs, to harmonise with it. 

To fulfil these conditions, any style must, Firstly, be 
one at present generally practised and understood, or some 
natural outgrowth or modification of it. 

Secondly, It must be free, with power of change and 
development ; neither so tied up with rules and precedents 
that it cannot be adapted to the irregularity and multifarious 
necessities of modern house-building, nor so logical and 
perfect that any alteration will spoil it. It should be 
capable of incorporating all sorts of materials, rude and 
refined, and of adopting any mode of using them in 
construction. 






122 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

Thirdly, Eegarded from the point of view of art, it should 
be such that the best art of our sculptors and painters may 
find it a suitable home. If Architecture is again to have 
these arts as her handmaids, she must rise to their level 
and suit herself to their style. 

Out of the multitude of the world's styles the first 
test reduces those possible for us to a very few. The 
only styles which have been lately, or are at present 
practised among us to any extent, are . GREEK, GOTHIC of 
several dates, and various forms of the revived ROMAN or 
CLASSICAL architecture. 

I propose to examine in succession each of these styles 
of architecture with the view of determining, if possible, 
which of them best complies with these requirements and 
is therefore best suited for use in our modern houses. 

The only satisfactory mode of doing so is by giving 
an account of each style, of its development and of the cir- 
cumstances and necessities out of which it grew. We may, 
then perhaps, judge how far any of them is likely to satisfy 
our modern requirements in house building. 

Independently of this more practical purpose, these styles 
are so important in themselves, as they constitute a con- 
siderable part of the mental development and history of 
our race, that an investigation of them should be of interest 
to all who care for art. 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. | 23 



CHAPTER Y. 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 



OF the styles which I have enumerated as practised 
among us, Gothic, especially in its highest and most 
perfect development in the reigns of Henry III. and 
Edward L, has had in late years the full tide of enthusiasm, 
eloquence, and fashion in its favour. 

In church-building it has had the field to itself, re- 
producing and finding perfectly appropriate the forms and 
arrangements of the thirteenth century ; and it is also 
now generally adopted for those places of worship in which 
preaching occupies a more prominent place, and in which con- 
sequently a modification of the ancient form is necessary. 

It does not follow, however, that because Gothic may be, 
for several reasons, the most common style for our churches, 
it is the most suitable for our houses. The wants to be 
satisfied as well as our traditions in each case are very dif- 
ferent. But in some respects a stronger claim can be made 
for Gothic houses than even for churches. In churches a 
Classic regularity and restraint is proper and fitting, while 



124 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



the freedom and pliability of Gothic make it specially 
suitable for buildings like dwelling-houses, which must have 
apartments of all sizes, and in which it is often convenient 
to have various levels of floor and various sizes of win- 
dows, and not to be tied down to the regularity of Classical 
arrangement. 

Gothic, too, was the natural growth of the country, and 
suited to the climate. It was the art language of our 
ancestors, always familiar to us in the village churches ; so 
that when the Classic was worn out, men returned to it as 
to an old friend absent only for a time. The romantic re- 
vival, of which Sir Walter Scott was the prophet, and the 
religious revival, which strove to bring the Church into 
sympathy with a larger unity and a higher antiquity than 
had been thought of since the Reformation, may have helped 
to revive it ; but its principles once studied, it was found 
more practical for our use than Italian porticoes, which were 
no protection in a rainy climate and blocked out the window- 
light of a dark one. So that men of common sense and 
without enthusiasm adopted it. 

So far as artistic merit was concerned, the dregs of the 
Classic had no power to oppose it. It has an interest and 
beauty of a kind that appeals to common men the beauties 
of tracery and carving, of stained glass and coloured tiles 
which do not need perpetually to lean on buildings in Italy 
as the standards of excellence. The causes which produced 
it gave rise also to a school of painting perfectly in harmony 
with it, which absorbed much of the enthusiasm and talent 
of the younger artists, and which, moreover, understood 
and carried into practice the idea that painting is worthily 
engaged in adorning the walls of buildings. 

By the energy of Pugin mainly, in the first instance, a 
class of workmen were trained capable of carrying out Gothic 
designs, and of providing suitable decorations and furniture 
not masons and joiners merely, but carvers who could 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 125 

work out their own ideas. The forgotten arts of hammered 
brass arid iron, of encaustic tiles and stained glass, were 
revived, and have now become flourishing trades. 

To the Gothic revival is due the credit of giving a new 
impetus to all the arts, and of letting men feel that art was 
a subject not merely for a dilettante few, but in which every 
one could take an interest. Although it has not conquered 
the country, its influence has been everywhere felt. This, 
however, has brought out prominently a weakness in it, 
which was not developed while it was opposed. The style 
is attempted now by architects who understand little about 
it, and by common builders who understand nothing, who, 
to buildings formed on the old Classic traditions, which still 
rule the mass of the building trades, add stopt chamfers or 
quatrefoils or pointed windows, producing a form of Gothic 
without its spirit or its power. It is becoming vulgarised, 
and, as a fashion of dress, when it finds its way down to the 
lower strata of society, disgusts those who first adopted it, by 
its travesty of the original form ; so, many of those who 
were the most enthusiastic admirers and students of Gothic, 
who understood its principles and practised it successfully, 
are giving it up for domestic buildings 

But the style is still largely employed, not only in 
churches, but in civil and domestic buildings. The new Law 
Courts in the Strand, one of the most important buildings 
of this generation, are being built in it. Its influence on 
modern architecture has been so great that, without a know- 
ledge of the style, we should be ignorant of one of the most 
important movements of our day in the province of art. I 
shall therefore give an account of its rise and development^ 
of the circumstances out of which it sprung, and the principles 
which determined its forms. Such an account must be to a 
large extent theoretical, and its truth must be determined 
by its being an adequate explanation of the facts. Any 
views on such a well worn subject cannot be altogether 






126 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



original ; if they were I should have a strong suspicion of 
their truth ; but I have ventured to give some theories and 
explanations which, so far as I am aware, have not been 
previously advanced. 

England and France each developed their own forms of 
Gothic architecture, similar advances being made inde- 
pendently in both countries about the same time, as is the 
case at present in astronomy and other sciences. The style 
was imported into England, already somewhat advanced, 
from France, and there, from the more logical character of 
the people, less tolerant of compromise than ourselves, its 
development can best be traced. It sprang from an imi- 
tation of the buildings which the Romans during several 
centuries of occupation, with their faculty of giving their 
conquered provinces not only their language but their man- 
ners, had left everywhere throughout Gaul, in their own 
round-arched style, palaces, baths, aqueducts, bridges, 
basilicas, and villas or country houses like villages, con- 
sisting of straggling agglomerations of buildings one story 
high connected by covered colonnades for country residence 
and the cultivation of the soil. After a century or two 
of pillaging excursions, the German barbarians settled in 
the land. By the middle of the sixth century the Franks 
had occupied the whole country except part of Languedoc 
held by the Yisigoths, the east held by the Burgundians, 
and Brittany, which was not conquered. By these conquests 
they lost the social organisation they had brought with 
them. Ceasing to be a conquering army under a single 
head, the habit which Caesar and Tacitus had observed, iu 
their ancestors arose again among them, each tribe dwelling 
apart, isolated from its neighbours by tracts of waste land. 
Military chiefs became landed proprietors heads of little 
independent sovereignties uncontrolled by the central power. 
Their companions in arms, almost their equals before, were 
now their dependents. With their love of plunder and

fighting, when there were no more villages and towns to 
pillage, they took to fighting among themselves, and it 
was some centuries before even the rude national unit}' of 
feudalism became a fact as well as an idea. 

In this anarchy the monasteries were the only refuge of 
civilisation, preserving some traditions of Roman art and 
order, and organising needful trades into guilds, a system 
afterwards adopted in the towns when, in the beginning 
of the tenth century, they began to recover their freedom. 

When, with rising civilisation, churches or monasteries 
and towns began to be built, architecture had to begin at the 
beginning again. Roman buildings remained everywhere, 
but no one knew how they had been constructed. The 
people copied them in their new buildings as well as they 
could, making up for miserable construction by lining them 
inside with marble and gaudy painting. 

When they began to build churches they attempted a 
reproduction of the old basilicas, or halls for the administra- 
tion of justice, the form already adopted for churches 
and which they still retain a large central nave or vessel, 
with an aisle or passage along each side, about half the 
width and height of the nave, opening into it through a 
range of pillars supporting round arches, above which was 
a range of windows called a clerestory, lighting the central 
nave. 1 At first, as they were unable from poverty and want 
of skill to reproduce the Roman vaulting, the roofs were 
wooden. But churches in those days, like theatres now, 
were always being burnt, and attempts were made to make 
the roofs as well as walls of incombustible material. In the 
south of France this was attempted without the use of wood 
by a plain waggon vault, as it is called, from being like 
the cover of a long waggon stretched on half hoops. This

Originally an open court surrounded by arched colonnades. Trajan's Column stood 
in the centre of such a portico. In later times the court was roofed in, and became 
the nave, the side colonnades the aisles.

vault they covered with solid masonry in the ordinary form 
of a roof (fig. 25). But for this a round arch was very 
unsuitable ; a pointed one saved weight on the apex and had 
less thrust (figs. 26 and 30). Wherever they got the idea, 
whether out of their own heads, which is not impossible, or 
through Venice from the East, where the pointed arch seems 

to have been used con- 
tinually since the time 
of the Pyramids and Nine- 

pig . as. Fig. 26. veh, it was almost imme- 

ROUND AND POINTED WAGGON VAULTS. diately adopted for vault- 
ing. The arches opening between nave and aisles and 
those of the windows were still round. 

In another way the pointed arch was found advantageous. 
Attempts, again from a desire for fire-proof construction, 
were made to build domes. Grothic had once a chance of 
becoming a domical style of architecture. If a square is 
supported on four arches, and carries a dome (fig. 27, plan), 
the bottom of the dome being quite inside the angle 
pillars, must be supported from them by four spherical 
triangles (a a, figs. 27, 28, and 29) whose points rest 

each on one of the 
pillars, and whose 
upper edges form to- 
gether the lowest ring 
of the dome. These 
triangles resting on 
their points, their tops

of one of the supporting arches, are called pendentives, 
from their hanging as it were in the air. Now if the 
arches whose curves their sides follow are pointed (fig. 29), 
the pendentive will be longer than if the arches were round, 
and the projection being the same, will not slope so steeply 




GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 



129 



forward ; while, if the arches are round, the top part of these 
pendentives must project actually level. Consequently a 
dome is more easily placed on pointed arches than on round. 

Neither of these styles of Gothic was ever developed. 
In them the windows and openings always remained round. 
The domical style with the means at the command of the 
builders was suited only for small churches, arid could not 
serve the needs of the great towns of the north. The style 
with waggon vaults was suited only for the south, for 
churches so constructed were difficult to light. To form an 
abutment for the massive central vault the lower side aisles 
had to be carried up to its springing, thus abolishing the 
clerestory and preventing any light getting into the central 
nave except from the side aisles, leaving the central vaults 
dark caverns (fig. 30). Then the roofs all of stone did 
not do. Water got through their upper surface, as will 
happen, and filtered through 
the solid roof in devious 
courses, the place where it 
appeared on the inside 
giving no indication of the 
position of the leak out- 
side; so that it was found 
necessary, especially when 
the vaulting became more 
intricate in form, to make 
it merely an inner ceiling, 
protected outside by a 
simple wooden-framed roof. 1

France, in what was called the Royal Domain, comprising

large, the builders confined their fireproof constructions to 
the side-aisles, for they were unable to vault over the wider 
central portion, nor could they afford to lose the range of 
windows, or clerestory, as it is called, which lighted this 
central part, by raising the side-aisles so as to make them 

abutments to a waggon 
vault. For this difficulty 
they found in Roman 
work a solution which 
enabled them to vault 
the central nave and yet 
preserve the clerestory. 
By dividing the con- 
tinuous waggon vault of 
the nave into square com- 
partments, and running 
another vault across 
each compartment, so that the two vaults intersected, as the 
Romans had done, they concentrated the thrust on the four 
angles of the compartment, where it was abutted, at first 
ineffectually by tall buttresses, but with larger experience 
completely, being carried down to the ground by half an 
arch above the aisle roofs, to which is given the name of 
flying buttress. At the same time an arched space was left 
clear in each compartment of the nave above the aisle roof 
in which windows could be opened. These improvements 
are shown in fig. 31. This form of vaulting is called 
groining, in contradistinction to the continuous waggon 
vault, as the masses of the vault are divided and joined 
at a point like the limbs to the trunk in the human groin. 

This system of vaulting it was easy to apply either to 
the nave, leaving the aisles with wooden roofs, or to the 
aisles only with wooden roofed nave ; but to vault both 
at the same time, using only the Roman round arch, was 
a problem of some difficulty. For, if the width of the 




GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 131 

nave was taken as the size of the square of vaulting, 
the vaults of the narrower aisles, springing from the 
piers of the wider nave, become oblong in plan, the 
arches across the aisles being only half the size of those 
into the nave (fig. 31), and the vaults rising from these 
lower arches to the higher ones having an awkward 
domical appearance. 

If, again, the aisle vaults, as well as those of the nave, 
were made square in plan, each square of the nave corre- 
sponding with two squares of the aisles on each side 
(fig. 32), the thrust of the nave vault was brought on every 
second pier only. 

When semicircular arches only are 
used, those across the diagonals of the 
square of vaulting being larger and 
higher than those of the sides of the 
square, the windows under them cannot ^- 32. VAULTING 

' SQUARE IS PLAN. 

be as high as the centre of the vault. 
Light is thus lost, and a mass of dead wall is needed over 
the clerestory windows to form a level bearing for the beams 
of the roof above the central vault. In other positions, 
also, the round arch was found awkward. Where the piers 
were close together, as round the apse of a church, the 
arches resting on them, had to be " stilted," as it is called, 
in order that their crowns might be on the same line as 
those of the wider arches down the sides of the church ; that 
is, they were perched on the top of straight piers, down 
which their mouldings were continued to the line of the 
capitals. 

By the use of the pointed arch, all these difficulties were 
got over. By means of it arches of different spans could be 
made all the same height. By breaking the round arch 
into two parts, attached by a point at the top, the arch could 
be widened or narrowed like a pair of compasses, and by 
adding to the length of the legs in the longer stretches, 

K 2 



32 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



it could be kept the same height as in the narrower 
stretches. 

In this way the determination to render churches fire- 
proof by means of vaulting produced the pointed style of 

architecture which \\e 
call Gothic. In conse- 
quence of being so con- 
structed, our old cathe- 
drals havebeen preserved 
to us. Canterbury and 
Chartres, in our own 
time, Rheims in the six- 
teenth century, have had 
their wooden roofs which 
covered the vaulting 
destroyed by fire, with- 
out injuring the build- 
ings under them. 

For some time after 
the discovery of the 

pointed arch the width of the nave, as in fig. 32, continued 
to be taken as the size of the square of vaulting, the 
aisles also being vaulted in square compartments, two to 
each square of the nave on each side. The defect of the 
thrust of the nave vault coming on each 
second pier only was partially obviated 
by springing a subsidiary rib from the 
intermediate pier, thus dividing the vault 
into six parts, instead of four, whence 
this method is called sexpartite vaulting 
(fig. 32). Taking the width of the aisles 
as the size of the square of vaulting, which the use of 
the pointed arch rendered possible, obviated all difficulties 
(figs. 33 and 34). The central nave vault became thereby 
oblong, its length the width of the nave, its breadth the

width of the aisles, and the arches across the nave twice the 

span of those against the clerestory walls, which, springing 

from the same piers as the nave arcade, were of the same 

span. (Fig. 33.) The clerestory windows were raised to 

the full height of the apex of the central vault, sometimes 

even higher, and the thrust of the vault was 'equal on each 

pier. Thus, by the use of the pointed arch the problems of 

making both nave and 

aisles fireproof by 

vaulting, of bringing 

the thrust of the 

vault equally on every 

pier, and of making 

the vaults at the side 

walls and across the 

church as high as the 

diagonal vaults, were 

completely solved. 

Even after the vaults 
became pointed, the 
windows under them 
continued round- 
headed in form. (Fig. 
35.) But a round 
arch under a pointed 
one leaves a space 
something like an 
arrow-head in shape 
between them, which it was soon seen could be made avail- 
able as window. The shapes of the windows were therefore 
made the same as that of the vaults, and the same form 
was, from the principles of harmony, carried out every- 
where throughout the building. 

The development of the style was doubtless influenced 
not only by the mechanical requirements of which we have

traced the development, but by the sense of beauty in the 
mind of its inventors, and by the environment in which 
they found themselves placed. If, in the problem which 
they had to solve, they had been guided purely by mathe- 
matical principles, they would have found a more perfect 
solution, not in the pointed but in the elliptical arch. 
By means of it arches of different spans could have been 
made to intersect with perfect mathematical accuracy 
without recourse to the expedient which, in the light 
of mathematics, is a clumsier one, of vaulting ribs. But 
in the light of art the result would have been far less 
beautiful, and even it they had possessed mathematical 
knowledge sufficient for working out their problem by the 
use of the elliptical arch, their instinct as artists would 
have prevented them from adopting it. Besides this, 
opportunity had made them acquainted with the pointed 
arch. The Crusades had carried them to the East, which 
was its birthplace, and where they would see it still in 
use. 

Sir Gilbert Scott, in his lectures on Mediaeval Archi- 
tecture to the Students of the Royal Academy, opposes the 
theory I have attempted to state, that the introduction of 
the pointed arch was due to the necessities of vaulting. 
Describing the difficulty of groining oblong bays, he says, 1 
" The mathematical solution of the problem would have 
been to make the section of the narrower vault an upright 
semi-ellipse ; but this does not appear to have been at any 
period adopted, or, if at all, in exceptional cases only. The 
pointed arch would have been an approximate expedient, 
and its introduction has been very ingeniously attributed 
to this difficulty a theory to which I shall have again to 
allude." The architects of the south of France, he states 
(page 58, vol. i.), adopted the pointed vault in their barrel 

1 Vol. i. p. 57. 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 135 

vaults as having less outward thrust, " the same expedient 
was now had recourse to for groined vaulting, the main arches 
of which were, towards the middle of the twelth century, 
changed from the semi-circle to the pointed arch." " It 
will be seen from the above" (he continues in page 61) "that 
the pointed arch was not introduced into Mediaeval structure 
from mere caprice merely from seeing it elsewhere,' and 
taking a fancy to its form but from the necessities of con- 
struction ; from its increased strength and diminished thrust. 
It was used at first for the main arch only of the greater 
vault. The same reason soon led to its introduction 
wherever great weight was to be carried, as under towers, 
etc. ; but for all small arches the semi-circle was long re- 
tained. I have alluded to the very beautiful theory that 
it was introduced for the side arches of oblong groins, 
simply as a means of obtaining arches of equal height, 
with only half the span of those of the main vault. 
True it is that, at a later date, it became most useful for 
this purpose. But a careful study of the monuments, in 
which it is first systematically used, clearly shows that 
its introduction was from statical, and neither geometrical 
nor merely sesthetical motives ; for in the lace of that 
theory we find the narrower arch or wall-rib remaining 
rOund, long after the wider arch had become pointed. 
Such is the case in nearly all the earlier French transi- 
tional churches, as at Noyon and at St. Germain des Pres, 
and we see the same at Canterbury. In most of these 
buildings the narrow arch is semi-circular and stilted, 
and the crown of the cross vault raised, as before described, 
thus losing a part of the clerestory wall, a disadvantage 
obviated when the pointed arch became more frankly 
acknowledged." 

But the theory of the adoption of the pointed arch in 
vaulting, as I understand it and have attempted to state it, 
is not as Sir Gilbert Scott here implies, that it was in order 



136 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

to make the narrow side arch of an oblong vault as high as 
the wider cross arch. Where the pointed arch was de- 
manded, in vaults whether square or oblong in plan, was 
where it was first used, in the cross arches ; so that their 
crown might be as high as that of the diagonal arches, and 
the height of the church continuous along its length. As 
the windows in the clerestory wall were small, there was no 
need of increasing the height of the vault over them, and 
the accustomed round form was continued, till a growing 
sense of harmony made the wall vault also pointed. I 
therefore think that though in vaults oblong in plan, 
the smaller arch at the wall continued round after the 
cross vault became pointed, this does not disprove the theory 
that the use of the pointed arch was due to the constructive 
necessities of vaulting. It solved the problem of making 
the arches across the church as high as the diagonal arches 
of the vault. Sir Gilbert Scott considers that the pointed 
arch was adopted " from statical, and neither geometrical 
nor merely aesthetical motives" (p. 61, vol. i.), as having 
less outward thrust, the first situations in which it was used 
being the wide spanning arches of vaulting, and the arches 
carrying central towers and gables, and afterwards in the 
wide arches of nave arcades (pp. 235-6, vol. i.). But, as a 
matter of fact, geometrical reasons are stronger than statical, 
for its adoption in the arches across the nave. Round 
arches could be made to stand in this position,' and did 
stand, even with the rude building and imperfect buttress- 
ing of the early architects, and they also carried securely 
towers and gables. But only a pointed arch across the 
church could have its crown as high as that of the diagonal 
arch of the vault ; and, as the arches carrying towers and 
gables were continuations of these cross arches, they were 
naturally made of the same pointed form. The pointed 
arch, therefore, was not necessary for statical reasons, 
but it made the development of vaulting possible, and we

may therefore conclude that its introduction was due to 
this cause. 

A new impulse was given to the art of vaulting by the 
invention of YAULTINU-RIBS. In Roman groining the angle 
of the groin consists merely of a line formed by the inter- 
section of the two vaults, and the same system is followed 
in the earlier Romanesque buildings (see figs. 31 and 36). 
This line looks poor and weak, the 
vault seems to spring from a mere 
point. In St. Mark's, at Yenice, the 
intersecting angles of the vaults are 
rounded to allow the coating of mosaic 
to be carried over them. The Roman- 
esque builders disliked the harshness 
of square angles, and, in their desire 
to obtain effect by ornament, worked 
round moulding on the angles of their 
buttresses, and they did the same on the 
angles of intersection of the vaults (fig. 35) projecting 
them from the surface in the form of ribs, which gave the 
reality as well as the appearance of strength to the angles. 

The use of these ribs did not at first alter the principle of 
construction ; each layer of stones in the vault w T as sup- 
ported as before by the layer below it. But it gave 
facilities in construction unknown in Roman vaulting. In 
it the forms of the angles of the groins are determined by 
the junction of the surfaces of the crossing vaults. Where 
vaults of different sizes cross each other, the line produced 
by their meeting at the angle is curved, making a weak and 
unpleasant-looking line. In Gothic vaulting the ribs de- 
termine the lines of construction, they are the prominent 
parts which give the appearance and effect to the archi- 
tecture ; the surfaces are comparatively unobserved, they 
may meet each other at any angle without detriment to the 
appearance, the junction being concealed by the rib ; and

OUT RIBS. 



138 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

are sometimes twisted into forms like a ploughshare. By 
the use of ribs vaults of irregular plan with arches of 
different widths could be easily constructed, and be made 
to look satisfactory. 

As the style advanced, these ribs were increased in 
number ; instead of appearing merely on the cross arches, 
and the angles of the diagonal, the broad surfaces of the 
vault were broken up first by one then by more ribs (see B 
and C, fig. 45, p. 160). These additional ribs strengthened 
the vault, the surfaces, or filling in between the ribs, could 
be made thinner and the vault lighter, and consequently 
have less thrust. JEsthetical considerations may also have 
had some influence. The change was in harmony with 
others in the architecture ; the surfaces of the windows also 
were broken up by the bars of tracery. 

As the style progressed, the introduction of vaulting ribs 
changed the principle of construction in the vaulting. In- 
stead of the vault being a broad arch surface, the ribs 
became its bearing lines, a skeleton of curved beams, sup- 
porting the surface of the vault, as iron beams support a 
concrete floor. This surface or filling in was formed of 
long stones t&gt;r of flat arches, resting from rib to rib. In 
Boman vaulting the surface is the vault. In Gothic vault- 
ing we might remove the surface and the vault would 
stand. 

These ribs were made to spring each from a separate 
slender column, one of a cluster. As the style developed 
the columns and the vaulting ribs in late Gothic sometimes 
coalesced, the capitals dividing them became absorbed, the 
ribs rising without break from the base of the building to the 
crown of the arch. The feeling of ascent and growth thus 
given, with the branching groining ribs meeting overhead, 
gave rise to the popular theory that Gothic architecture 
sprang from an imitation of a forest with its spreading 
branches. The history of the style proves the theory 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 139 

erroneous ; yet it is true that Gothic has in it something of 
the spirit and growth of forest life, as Greek architecture 
has sympathy with the higher forms of animal life. 

The windows at first were small, leaving large surfaces 
of wall to be decorated with colour and painting, and the 
decoration was carried out over the windows also, by the 
use of stained glass. This latter mode of decoration, once 
introduced, was felt to be so brilliant and charming, that 

" O 7 

henceforth it ruled the development of the style. The object 
of every change was to reduce the surface of masonry, 
and give more space for stained glass. The small windows 
were put closer together, and the masonry between them 
reduced to single upright bars of stone, called rnullions, 
narrow on the face but deep across the plane of the 
window, so as to give as much opening as possible for 
glass, while retaining strength. Openings shaped like 
flowers of three or four, or more leaves, were placed above 
them ; the corners left between were pierced ; the stone 
between these openings was reduced to bars bending round 
the foliated forms (to which the name of TRACERY is given) ; 
and thus at last one great window was formed, which filled 
the whole space under the vault (fig. 35). 

These mullioned and traceried windows are one of the 
most charming features of Gothic architecture, so beautiful 
in themselves that, like Greek porticos, they have been 
used even when the causes which led to their adoption do 
not exist. In large windows, however especially when 
these are used in the same building along with smaller ones 
a division of their surface by some such means must 
always remain one of the simplest and most admirable 
means of producing architectural effect. Windows of all 
sizes can thus be brought into harmony with each other, 
an immense advantage in domestic architecture. The 
architecture of the walls is, as it were, carried over the 
windows by bars of stone, giving them greater strength 



140 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

and solidity and interest, than if they remained mere great 
holes in the wall. 

The form of these stone bars will naturally partake of the 
constructive lines of the architecture. Under vaultings 
they will be curved, but when the architectural construction 
is altogether in perpendicular and horizontal straight lines, 
as in our ordinary domestic architecture, the straight form 
which bars of stone naturally take will be simpler and 
more suitable. 

Gothic architecture had a magnificent opportunity of 
development in the construction of the great cathedrals, 
which, in France, were all built at the end of the twelfth 
and beginning of the thirteenth centuries. 

These were civil as well as ecclesiastical buildings ; in 
fact, the distinction between the two provinces was a thing 
unknown at the time, and is wholly a modern idea, which 
we never probably would have had, except for the dif- 
ferences in religious belief which arose among us at the 
Reformation. The State is merely the community acting 
in combination for those purposes in which combined is 
more convenient than individual action. With us its action 
is now almost confined to justice, police, war, and possibly 
education. 1 When religious belief was uniform, as in the 
Middle Ages, State action included religion. The bishops 
and abbots were feudal barons, with civil jurisdiction ; and 
all State action had some religious character and sanction. 
The cathedrals were the great meeting-places of the city, 
used for secular purposes, such as the administration of 
justice, and even for histrionic performances 2 (which, again 
were religious in character), as well as for mass. 

They sprung up just after the towns, along with the right 
to have walls, had attained freedom and privileges, of which

GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 141 

they remain the monuments ; and as rivals to the great 
castles of the lay, and the monasteries of the religious 
barons. .The bishops and secular clergy went heartily with 
the movement, which asserted for them the power and 
importance which had been largely absorbed by the mo- 
nasteries. All the important towns seemed seized with 
a mania to rebuild their cathedrals with a magnificence pre- 
viously unknown. The new architecture, taking nothing 
for granted, governed only by logical necessities of con- 
struction, is an expression of the rationalism of which 
Abelard sowed the seed in modern thought, though devoted, 
like him, to the service of the Church. The architects 
were laymen, for the most part, as in several instances 
given by Viollet-le-Duc we know from their names, and 
the representations which occur of some of them in the lay 
dress. He states that the regular clergy those living 
under a rule, or monks, who had hitherto been the sole 
depositaries of art and culture disliked the movement. It 
was natural that they should, for it meant that their use, 
and consequently their importance, was gone ; and, after 
pointed architecture was invented, they still continued to 
practise their own old round-arched style. 

This is the reason why the architecture of the French 
cathedrals is in almost every instance pointed, while in 
England it is generally round-arched. In France the 
cathedrals were rebuilt in the new style. They were the 
churches generally of the secular clergy, not of the religious 
orders. In England, in accordance with our spirit of 
compromise, our cathedrals were generally monasteries or 
minsters also, and were built while the round-arched style 
prevailed. 

The main characteristics of Grothic are its system of pointed 
vaulting and its traceried windows, filled with stained glass. 
The former, in the course of development, led to other 
peculiar features, such as the clusters of slender columns, 



142 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

each carrying a vaulting rib, by which the lines of the 
ceiling were carried clown to the floor, giving the feeling 
of height and ascending growth ; to harmonise with which, 
and not from any necessities of structure or of climate, 1 the 
roofs were made steep and sharply pointed. The style 
possessed also a beautiful and vigorous style of carving, 
founded on natural foliage, and truthful and admirable 
modes of metal work. 

The change to copying natural foliage for architectural 
ornament, instead of the carving of wild grotesques of the 
earlier round-arched style, which the Benedictines of Cluny 
carried to its greatest excess, is due not only to the decay 
of barbarism, and the growth of civilisation and refinement, 
but to the denunciations of St. Bernard. Preaching at

Yezelay, where we can still see them, 2 " what business," he 
asked, " had these devils and monstrosities in Christian 
churches, taking off the attention of the monks from tlieir 
prayers ? " In the churches of the Cistercian order which 
he founded, his puritanism forbad ornament altogether, 
which does not, however, divest them of their art, but 
produces the manliest and severest type of Gothic. When 
the artistic genius of the people was untrammelled, 
it produced the exuberance of decoration inspired by 
the appreciation of the beauty of foliage, which usually 
characterises the style. 

This cathedral-building mania (which was really analogous 
to the railway mania of our own day) lasted in France just 
about eighty years, the cities then ceasing to find that their 
privileges and the importance of the clergy (even of the 
secular clergy) were identical. Strifes arose, the clergy 
forbad the use of the cathedral bells for town meetings ; 
the building impetus stopped before a single cathedral was

finished, and though parts have since been built, most of 
them are unfinished, and not one has been completed 
according to the original design. 

The style thus developed was, of course, used for other 
purposes than churches. The possibility of building in any 
other style than the prevalent one, or even the existence of 
any other, was inconceivable in times when Roman emperors 
were represented sitting under pointed arches ; and scenes 
of the New Testament were conceived of as transacted 
in mediasval cities, by people dressed in mediseval costume. 1 

Castles and houses were therefore built in Gothic, and 
the mouldings and minor ornaments were the same as in 
churches. Pointed windows and tracery, however, it was 
found necessary from the first to modify ; while between 
vaulted floors, when height was valuable, flat arches 
segments of a circle, were adopted. 

Yery few specimens of Gothic houses remain anywhere. 
During the Middle Ages the style of living was poor and 
even miserable, as is proved by the general prevalence 
of leprosy, testified to by the necessity everywhere felt of 
establishing lazar houses. The disease has ceased in every 
European country except Norway, in parts of which the 
people are miserably fed. 

The houses except in the rich cities of Italy, one of 
which, such as Yenice, had the wealth and power of a 
State like England were generally poor and small. Many 
of them were built of wood, and in the course of centuries 
got out of repair; and almost everywhere the more 
comfortable style of living in every class of society, which 
the Revival brought with it, caused them to be rebuilt. In 

1 One of the most curious instances of this dormancy of the historical faculty 
occurs in a picture at Antwerp, of our Lord bearing His cross, in which the " stations "

and the people were too poor to rebuild, Gothic houses still 
exist. One of the most important is the Goliath House, at 
Katisbon (shown in fig. 38) ; so called from the gigantic

representation of David and Goliath which remains on 
its wall. 1 

The drawing of a street at Ratisbon (fig. 39) gives an 
idea of what a northern middle age city must have 
looked like. Every important house had its tower to de- 
fend it and to retire to in case of attack. In these houses 
there is no attempt at symmetry or regularity ; the win- 
dows are of any size required, and are placed wherever con- 
venience dictates. The pointed arch is used consistently 
throughout, the larger square windows being probably later 
insertions. 

But in the application of Gothic to house building from 
the earliest period, the window openings were made square- 
headed. Numerous instances occur, where under a pointed 
arch the window openings are square. Sometimes the 
pointed arch is purely ornamental, and carved on a simple 
straight lintel. 

The pointed windows in the old house at Boppart on the 
Rhine (fig. 37, page 144), which appear to be a later altera- 
tion of the original design, illustrate this. They probably 
once had mullions. 

The glass in houses was usually set in wooden frames so 
as to open like shutters, and the architects were too sensible 
to make these in a form so awkward for wood construction 
as a pointed arch. These frames of glass were moveable, 
and in royal progresses were sometimes removed with the 
furniture from one residence to another. 

Even when, in great halls built for civil and domestic 
purposes, pointed vaults and pointed windows were used, 
the lower lights, being arranged to open for air and 
view, were always square-headed. The glass in the upper 
lights was fixed, being let into grooves in the stone as 
in church windows. In a house at Rheims, of which I give

the statues in pointed arches between the windows, each

decorative features such as the niches arid the range of

little arches supporting the cornice it is frankly abandoned 
in the windows, where the form would riot have been 
practical. The same tendency to abandon the pointed arch 
in domestic windows is found in England also, as may be 
seen in the illustration of Markerifield Hall, near Ripon, in 
Yorkshire (fig. 41), from Parker's ' English Domestic Archi-

tecture of the Middle Ages,' for the use of which I am 
indebted to the kindness of Mr. James Parker. 

It is situated in Yorkshire, ahout two miles west of 
Ripon, and seems to me a charming example of an English 
Gothic house. The licence to crenellate it was obtained in 
1310, and it was probably commenced about that time. 
The large traceried window in the view is the eastern 
window of the chapel, which, as well as the great hall, is 
on the upper story, in accordance with the custom of the

fourteenth century. The windows to the right are those 
of the Solar behind the dais of the hall. These are square- 
headed, evidently made so from necessity, the floor above or 
the ceiling not allowing space for an arch. Where there is 
space, the windows are arched. 1 

It may be urged against the statement that vaulting is 
an essential of GTothic architecture, that Grothic churches,

as well as domestic buildings, in England especially, 
frequently had wooden ceilings, and this not always from 
economy, but, even where, as in St. Stephen's chapel at 
Westminster, the wealth of English art was lavished. 

This, however, does not disprove the fact that the pointed 
style arose from necessities of vaulting ; and, indeed, to the 
use of wooden roofs in England may, I think, be traced 
the abandonment of the pointed arch, and the adoption 
of the flattened perpendicular form : while in France, where 
the use of the vaulting was continued, the pointed arch also 
was retained to the last. The wooden ceiling left the walls 
divided into square-headed spaces (instead of the arched

ones under the vaulting), which a pointed window could not 
fill (fig. 42). The window arch formed, with the straight 
level cornice, awkward corner spaces, called spandrils, 
which there was always a difficulty to know what to do 
with. So the haunches of the arch were raised, making 
the window nearly square-headed, and adding the space occu- 
pied by the spandril to the amount of stained glass (fig. 43). 
The lines of the flattened arch were drawn in various 
ways, usually from four centres. Sometimes the upper lines 
which meet at the apex are quite straight, and in some 
cases the spandrils disappear altogether. So by gradual 
change the pointed arched window becomes a simple 
square-headed window filled with tracery.

HOUSE OF JACQUES CCEUR AT BOURGES. 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 'J 55 

In every instance, in fact, in the history of the style in 
which the use of pointed vaulting was given up, the aban- 
donment of the pointed arch followed sooner or later. 

I have stated that it was not from any necessities of 
climate or construction that the roofs were made steep 
pitched, but to harmonise with the tendency to height 
and upward growth which was characteristic of the rest 
of Gothic architecture. When in English Gothic the hori- 
zontal cornice became predominant, and the arches became 
flattened, the roofs, as we shall see, became flattened in 
sympathy. In France the arches remained pointed, arid 
the roofs continued steep pitched. The tendency in the later 
French Gothic was rather to increase their height. These 
tall steep roofs became a feature of French architecture, 
and continued to characterise it when the Gothic styles had 
passed away, and had been superseded by the Classic. 

The house of Jacques Cceur, at Bourges, illustrates this. 
It was commenced in the middle of the fifteenth century (he 
purchased the site in 1443), and is one of the most splendid 
specimens which exist of Gothic domestic architecture. I 
have given plans of the ground-floor and first-floor in the 
sketch of the history- of planning in Chapter I. vol. ii. p. 28, 
figs. 139, 140. Fig. 44 shows part of the front, comprising 
the main entrance, with the chapel over it, and the turret 
which contains the stair leading to the chapel, carried up 
into a tall stone roof like a spire. The chapel is vaulted 
and its window is pointed. The other windows through- 
out the building are square-headed. 

Till the end of the thirteenth century the development of 
Gothic architecture, as I have described it, was similar in 
France, England, and Germany. 

There are some slight national differences, but every 
advance of the art was common to the civilisation of these 
countries. It was even carried as far as Norway, where 



156 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

the Cathedral of Drontheim, built in the thirteenth cen- 
tury, is in the ordinary style of the period. It is built 
of stone, not in the national wooden construction which 
the Norwegians did not abandon for ordinary churches. 
But the style of their carving in wood, which has always 
been a national art prosecuted during the six months of 
continual night in winter became, and still continues, 
thirteenth century Grothic in character. 

This similarity of style in the different countries of 
Europe was largely due to the organisation of the great 
monastic orders, who sent missionaries to found new houses 
and establish religion and civilisation in outlying districts, 
as well as to the unity of the Church under the Pope. The 
new inventions of architecture were carried everywhere, as 
those of engineering are at the present day. 

During the fourteenth century, when the style was esta- 
blished, each country took it into its own hands and 
developed it into a national style of its own. It is absurd 
to call these later styles degraded, as has been the fashion 
of late. Each of them, if studied without prejudice, will 
be seen to have developed characteristic and interesting, 
and often noble qualities of architecture. 

One common quality they had, as compared with the 
earlier style greater lightness and elegance in construc- 
tion, more window in proportion to wall, giving that effect 
of space, and height, and light, in the interior, which is 
the glory of Gothic. 

This was attained by more scientific construction and 
greater mechanical skill, which enabled the builders to dis- 
pense with the masses of material necessary in the earlier 
style. The interior of the church of St. fitienne du Mont 
in Paris a last expiring effort of Gothic commenced in 
1537, when Classic influence had begun to affect the forms 
and details exhibits the lightness and aspiration which 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 157 

are characteristic of the style more perfectly than purer 
examples. 

The same lightness and excellent construction is cha- 
racteristic of German Gothic, and especially of our English 
Perpendicular. 

So far as practical convenience is concerned, one of these 
great Perpendicular churches, unencumbered by massive 
columns, with its feeling of space, is more suitable for 
our congregational purposes, than those built in what is 
considered the more perfect periods of Gothic. 

The skill in mechanical construction made wonderful 
feats of masonry a characteristic of these later styles. 
Great pendants are suspended in a mysterious way from 
the roofs. The stone is twisted about like willow wands. 
The mouldings interpenetrate, the design disappearing 
as if into the stone and coming out again. Great spires 
are made of open lace work. 

These later styles of France, England, and Germany, were 
also characterised by a completeness in carrying out the 
design which was sometimes lacking in the earlier style, 
even, for instance, in the noble south porch of Chartres 
Cathedral. But by continual slight improvements and 
refinements roughnesses were toned down, and hitches 
where parts did not fit perfectly together were removed, not 
without some loss of the earlier strength and vigour. 

In the tracery of the later styles there was also a common 
character. As has been explained, tracery arose from com- 
bining into one large window the narrow windows and the 
trefoils and quatrefoils over them in the thin wall which 
closed the space below the pointed vault. The effect of the 
window depended on the disposition of these flower-shaped 
piercings, which seen from the inside showed as forms of 
light, from the outside as dark forms ; leaving between them 
paces in the stone plate in which they were pierced, of any 
shape that happened to turn out. The irregular shape of 



158 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

these stone interstices was felt to be. an imperfection. The 
development of tracery consisted in giving form and beauty 
of line to them as well as to the openings. In the windows 
of St. Stephen's Chapel, Westminster (fig. 42, page 152), this 
attained equally for both. In the art of this period tracery 
reached its highest perfection. But the process could not 
stop, for growth is the condition of life, sometimes, as in 
this case, of a life that had passed its prime and was drawing 
on to decrepitude and death. 

Attention was more and more given to the solids, instead 
of the openings of the tracery. The stone was reduced to 
regular bars, and the forms and dispositions of these became 
the objects of design, producing w r hat is called bar tracery, 
as distinguished from the early form, which is called plate 
tracery, from the openings being pierced in a plate of 
stone. 

But with these fundamental points of character in 
common the later Gothic styles were strikingly different in 
outward form and appearance. In French Gothic, as has 
been stated, pointed vaults were retained, and the form of 
the great windows, filling the wall space under these, 
continued pointed. 

In harmony with the curved forms of the arch, and in 
the desire for increased softness and refinement of line, the 
bars of the tracery were bent into curved flowing lines, like 
the form of the flame of a torch, whence this kind of tracery 
is called Flamboyant. The chapel of Jacques Cceur's house, 
at Bourges (fig. 44), illustrates these flowing lines of tracery 
which are playfully formed at the top into a fleur-de-lis. 

In the church of St. Eustache, in Paris, commenced in 
1532, in the last stage of Gothic, when the Classic influence 
had begun to prevail, the tracery of the windows is bent 
into the shape of hearts and ovals. The softness and sweet- 
ness of the flowing lines had begun to pall. In spasmodic 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 159 

efforts to avoid this, by producing new sensations, the 
forms of the tracery became* sometimes uncouth and ugly. 

But in the glory of the stained glass, with which the 
windows were filled, this was not marked. The buildings 
were light and splendid, rich in delicate carving, relieved by 
intervals of plain simple masonry which gave massiveness 
and strength. 

In English Gothic also, in the later decorated style 
while it still retained the pointed arch, the forms of the 
tracery were flowing, and the design often beautiful. 
They never sunk to the degeneracy of the later French 
and German. The latest Gothic of England took a 
different direction. The explanation I have ventured to 
suggest, that the arches became flattened as a consequence 
of the adoption of wooden ceilings, is not disproved by the 
fact that vaulted churches were built in which the vaults 
were of the same flattened form. The vaults were flattened 
to suit the windows. The architecture gave up the 
tendency to curvature of line which marked the earlier 
styles ; its masses and its lines were characterised through- 
out by a squareness of form in sympathy with the shape 
to which the windows were tending. 

A peculiar character of the latest English .Gothic is 
the singular system of vaulting, found I believe, in no 
other country, called from its resemblance to an open fan, 
fan vaulting. 

It is found usually in conjunction with the flattened arch, 
and it has sometimes been imagined that the one feature 
was dependent on the other, that the flat arch was the cause 
of the fan vaulting, or the fan vaulting of the flat arch. 
The former cannot be the case, for instances of fan vaulting 
are found with sharp pointed arches, and we have seen that 
the flat arch arose from a different cause. The principle 
and origin of each are wholly independent. 



160 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



I venture to give an explanation of the principle an 
origin of fan vaulting, which is so simple that it looks as if 
it were true. My only doubt is that, so far as I am aware, 
it is new. 

I have already explained (page 138) how the broad 
surfaces, or filling in of the vault (A, fig. 45), were divided 
by intermediary ribs, first by a single one in each space 
as at B, then by several as at C. 

It will be seen on the plan (B and C) that these ribs are all 

of different lengths, that 
they are like a badly shaped 
fan. The angle rib looks 
too prominent and awk- 
ward ; the arrangement has 
an incomplete and un- 
finished appearance. This 
is got over by making all 
the ribs of the same length, 
by cutting off their points 
within the line of a quad- 
rant as at D, thus making 
a perfectly-shaped fan. 
But this breaks the continuity of the diagonal arches 
These fans or quadrants must tumble together unless the 
diagonal arch is completed by a keystone or its equi- 
valent. For this purpose a ring is dropt in at E. formed 
of stones with radiated joints, which thus resist the inward 
thrust. 

This ring we might fill in with a flat stone, or we might 
drop a pendant from it, like a stalactite from the roof of a 
cave. The construction seems to suggest this and it -did 
suggest it, as we know by innumerable examples. 

The vaulting of the crossing of St. George's Chapel at 
Windsor (fig. 46) is a splendid example of fan vaulting. 
The nearer bay shows another mode of breaking up the 




Fig. 45. PLANS OF VAULTING SHOWING 
DEVELOPMENT. 




Fig. 46. VAULTING OF THE CROSSING, ST. GEORGE'S CHAPEL, WINDSOR. 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 163 

surface of the vault, the ribs branching out as the spaces 
between them widen with carved bosses at the junction. 

I have said that fan vaulting was not caused by the low 
Perpendicular arch, for it is found with sharp-pointed 
arches. But it is clear that its adoption must have made it 
more easy to vault with low flat arches, when the crown of 
the vault was a flat stone or a descending pendant, instead 
of an ascending point. 

In the latest style of English Gothic the tracery of the 
window heads ceased to flow, and became straightened into 
upright bars, whence the style derives its name of Per- 
pendicular. But, as expressing the true character of the 
style, the name (like Gothic itself, ' Queen Anne/ and so 
many others in architecture) is a misnomer. The main 
lines of the style, as compared with those of any other style 
of Gothic in England or elsewhere, and the disposition of 
masses which give it its character, are horizontal, in sympathy 
with the level cornice which, I think, determined its origin. 
Perpendicular architecture loses the tendency which every 
other form of Gothic had to increase the height of the 
building by high peaked roofs, which specially characterises 
the contemporary styles in France, where the roofs (as we 
have seen) became steeper than ever. The roofs are 
flattened to a lower pitch than that of a Greek temple ; 
among the lines of the tracery straight horizontal bars are 
introduced, the horizontality of which is strengthened by 
treating them as cornices with miniature battlements (fig. 
43, p. 152). The pointed windows in a tier one above the 
other, in each bay, no longer lead the eye upward ;. but, 
square in form, they are massed close together in long 
horizontal lines of light. The belfries cease to be drawn 
up into spires, and become square towers, finished at the 
top with a level cornice and parapet. In domestic archi- 
tecture the sweet low level lines of the Tudor house, in 

M 2 



164 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

which the roof is often so low as to be concealed by the 
parapet, are in direct contrast to the tall peaked roofs of 
the French chateau of the same period, which still inherited 
the G-othic principle of height. In Morton Hall (fig. 47), 
the low-pitched roofs and long ranges of low lights exhibit 
this tendency. If the name of the style is to be descriptive 
of its character, it should be called the Horizontal variety 
of Gothic, instead of ' Perpendicular.' 

It has been the fashion to abuse our English Perpendicular 
churches, and much beautiful work in the style has in the 
last few years been destroyed, though it had three centuries 
of antiquity to boast of, because the clergyman or archi- 
tect disliked it, and preferred a modern imitation of the 
earlier style. 1 

The dislike to Perpendicular architecture in which we 
have all been trained has arisen, I believe, from our judging 
it through the modern imitations of the last generation. 
For a like reason it is perhaps possible the earlier styles 
may find little favour with the coming generation. But 
if we look at the Perpendicular style only in its genuine 
productions we can appreciate its high artistic qualities. 

1 It is dismal to think of the destruction of historical monuments of the last three 
centuries, which the demon of "Restoration" has perpetrated in this generation. 
Perpendicular windows everywhere have been destroyed, as in the great church at 
Yarmouth, where some which contained old stained glass have been replaced by 
modern ones. The outlines of churc'hes which have been landmarks for centuries 
(e.g., Durham Cathedral, and Jarrow Church) have almost everywhere been altered ; 
the towers often swamped by tall new roofs of bright tiles with ornamental ridging, 
replacing the old flat lead roofs, which, by the contrast, gave them presence and 
dignity. Thus, every now and then some ignorant person, making the obvious 
discovery that the beautiful Perpendicular porch in the centre arch of the front of 
Peterborough Cathedral is not part of the original design, proposes to remove it. 
This porch is an instance, among many, of the skill of the Perpendicular architects in 
the disposition of the masses of their buildings so as to produce architectural effect. 
Without it the look of size in the three great arches would be gone ; and it has been 
most skilfully designed so as to hide the disagreeable effect of the middle arch being 
the narrowest. At St. Albans the flat roof of oak and tiles, though the architect has 
declared it can be made sound, is to be covered by a tall one of deal ; the object 
apparently being to produce a steep gable at the west end, and so give an excusa 
for a new front and the destruction of the great perpendicular west window. 



" 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 167 

By its common sense and severity it saved English Gothic 
from the looseness and degradation in striving after new 
sensations into which Gothic fell in other countries. 

So long, for instance, as the piercings were the guiding 
features of the tracery, it was right that the form should be 
foliated ; but when the bars of stone became predominant, 
it was more in accordance with common sense that these 
should be straight, than twisted and contorted into curves. 

In few styles of architecture has there been a truer sense 
of proportion, or greater skill in the disposition of the 
masses. In the grandeur of its towers it is unsurpassed, 
and the appearance of height in these is increased by the 
low roofs and the prevalence of the horizontal line, for 
which there is the authority of Greek architecture. 

GERMAN GOTHIC. One marked characteristic of the latest 
German Gothic is skill in performing wonderful feats in 
masonry. The art was in the hands of the masonic guilds, 
whose members, clever and highly-trained workmen rather 
than artists, thought the highest result attainable in archi- 
tecture was to produce curiosities of workmanship, in forms 
hat seemed impossible in the material. 

Great spires, as that of Freiburg, were constructed 
wholly of open tracery. The plans of spires are sometimes 
altered at each stage, so as to make difficulties, which skill 
in construction might overcome. Wonderful double cork- 
screw staircases, each twisting round the other, were made 
in some spires ; and such feats were thought more of than 
the outline. Mouldings were made to interpenetrate ; as for 
instance, an octagon moulding on. the base of a column 
being made to look as if disappearing in a circular one,, 
and then show itself again. Some of the shrines in which 
the Sacrament was kept are marvellous examples of this 
laborious playfulness. They run up in tall pinnacles, 
composed wholly of the most elaborate open work ; some- 



168 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



times they are made as if they had grown too tall for the 
church, but the top, just before it strikes the ceiling, bends 
and turns round into a crook. 

In Germany, as in other countries, the tracery abandoned 
geometric forms and became flowing in character like the 
French flamboyant. A favourite form for filling the circle 
at the head was one which may be made out in one of the 
chapel windows of the Gothic house at Boppart (fig. 49, 
page 176) in which the flowing lines form a figure like 
tadpoles chasing one another. 

The over sweetness and softness of the forms of flowing 
tracery, which began after a time to be felt ever} 7 where, 
was counteracted in Germany, and a foil given by simply 
breaking off the lines of the tracery and letting them end 
in a broken stump, whence the variety is called Stump 
Tracery. 

In the fine Eckfenster, or corner-oriel, at Augsburg, fig. 48, 
this kind of tracery is used as panel decoration, and also 
to support the base of the window, where it takes the form 
of intertwining branches. It looks almost as if its designers 
had believed in the theory that this was the origin of 
Gothic, and wished to illustrate it. The introduction of 
such forms shows that no farther advances were to be made 
in the style by legitimate methods that it was becoming 
worked out. It was a sign of old age, and showed that its 
end was near. The term " degraded," which is applied to 
the style which produces them, is in a sense true. It has 
not the simple and direct beauties of the earlier styles which 
found a legitimate architectural effect in the necessities of 
construction ; but its results are picturesque and interesting, 
and often beautiful, and it produced noble buildings, of which 
the nation is justly proud. 

Such an explanation of the development of Gothic archi- 
tecture as we have attempted to give, showing its principles, 
and the purposes which it was created to serve, enables us 




CORNER-ORIEL AT AUGSBURG. 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 171 

to form an opinion as to its suitableness for our domestic 
architecture. 

It disposes at once of several arguments against our 
using Gothic. It has been asserted that the style is gloomy 
and dark, and does not give sufficient light. Now, one 
of its chief characteristics, as has been shown, is that it 
is all window that the main aim in its development was 
to reduce the surface of the wall, and increase the space 
for stained glass. No doubt old Gothic castles had little 
window light, and this characteristic, adopted for pur- 
poses of defence, has been sometimes foolishly copied in 
modern Gothic houses ; but it was no essential of the 
style. 

It is called a barbarous product of the dark ages, when 
the people were serfs ; and one of the means by which 
a rich and powerful clergy kept them in ignorance and 
darkness. On the contrary, it was the product of the re- 
vived intelligence of the people, the outcome and sign of 
their civil freedom ; and it gives evidence of a development 
of art, of skill and refinement and grandeur in building, 
such as we are incapable of furnishing. 

It is said to be a style purely ecclesiastical ; it was just as 
much civil. In fact, in its origin, it was the lay style of 
architecture, as distinguished from the religious or monastic. 1 
That the monastic buildings in England and Scotland are 
frequently of pointed architecture, is due to the fact that 
the development of the monastic system took place later with 
us than in France, after the Gothic style was formed. 

But is there anything in the Gothic style which makes 
it (as is often asserted) more suitable than any other for our 
modern houses ? For this it is not sufficient that it appears to 
us more beautiful than any other. Our grandfathers thought 
Greek porticoes so beautiful, that they were willing to block 
up their window-light to have them. We see now that this 

1 See the evidence given by M. Viollet-le-Duc, ' Dictionnaire de I'Architecture.' 



172 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



practice was absurd (though Mr. Ayrton has repeated it in 
his new Post Office) ; that it destroys not only the expres- 
sion of truth in the houses, but the beauty of the portico, 
by using it where it has no meaning. No architecture can 
be satisfactory, even from an artistic point of view, whose 
forms are not founded on use. 

The Gothic system of vaulting does not suit our ordinary 
domestic requirements. For great halls, where any amount 
of height can be given, the height occupied by the pointed 
vault is no disadvantage. But it is one, in a building divided 
into stories, as our houses are ; and if in special building 
we want fireproof construction, we can get it conveniently 
and cheaply by means of iron and brick, or concrete, in the 
usual thickness of a floor, without the loss of space which 
would be involved between the springing of the vault and 
a level floor over its crown. 

In the modern revival oi the style, however, in not one 
in a hundred of our churches, 1 and in houses still seldomer, 
has any attempt been made to revive vaulting. It is there- 
fore hardly necessary to urge that a thing is unsuitable for 
us which we are never likely to use. Nor would the system 
of vaulting by flat arches be tolerated by us inside our 
houses. It would be thought prison-like and dismal, and, 
from its expense, it could never come into general use. 

From the example of the practice of mediaeval architects 
in domestic buildings, it is obvious that if we adopt Gothic 
architecture for our houses now, we ought to dispense with 
the use of the pointed arch. 

Yet, as in all copying, it is the form, and not the spirit 
of the original, which is apt to be retained, our architects 

1 Modern French churches are often vaulted in stone; but even in restoring 
ancient buildings it appears to be too expensive for our use. Sir Gilbert Scott, after 
describing the vaulting of Nantwich Church in Cheshire, in his Lectures on Mediaeval 
Architecture (vol. ii. p. 212), says, " I am imitating this to a certain extent in timber 
in the vaulting of the nave of Chester Cathedral, where, though the springers exist, 
the vaulting has never been completed." 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 173 

and* builders think they are working- iri the Gothic style 
when they put a pointed arch where it is not wanted, 
and means nothing possibly an arch one brick thick on 
the face of a wall,, supported by a wooden lintel inside 
while the whole construction and details of the house follow 
the ordinary Classic traditions. 

Old G-othic attempted honestly and fearlessly whatever 
use or necessity dictated. It has always the merit of truth- 
ful and apparent construction. But this to some extent 
unfits the style for modern use. It involves, unless when 
money could be lavished in decoration, an appearance of 
severity which does not accord with our modern feelings, 
and is least appreciated by the poorer and less educated, in 
whose houses, did we attempt really to carry out the prin- 
ciples of the style, it would be thoroughly disliked. Even 
in houses where no expense is spared, we should not like 
the appearance, however truthful it might be, of stone 
arches inside our rooms. 

Moreover truthfulness of construction cannot be classed 
among the excellences of modern G-othic. The copiers of 
the style, after the manner of copyists, are very apt in 
their zeal for the form to neglect the spirit. Few better 
illustrations of this could be given than the polished oak 
boxes given as wedding presents, with magnificent brass 
hinges meandering over them, which make it seem as if no 
amount of wear or ill-usage could separate the lid. Un- 
fortunately, those great hinges have no joint ; the work is 
done by a little feeble one, which it is attempted to conceal, 
fastened by two minute screw-nails ; so that, with all its 
appearance of massive strength, the lid could be prised open 
with a penknife. Of course a hinge is stronger if the tail is 
well fastened to the wood, and the old architects spread the 
hinges all over their church doors, in all sorts of playful, 
twisted forms ; but they were always the strengthening of 
a real hinge. So different is the modern Gothic practice of 



174 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



ornamental door hinges, that the workmen's ordinary name 
for them is " the shams." 

Again, why should Gothic grates have " fire dogs " ? 
Before the forests were cut down, when people burnt wood, 
they were necessary in the great old open hearths, for 
resting the logs on, to let air under them to keep them 
burning ; but it is sham Gothic to stick them on a grate 
for burning coals. And why should our gasaliers be made 
like the old coronas ? These were great rings or hoops, 
suspended from the ceiling, with candles stuck round the 
circle. When the gasalier is very large, and the lights 
numerous, this may still be a convenient arrangement for 
gas-lights; but in a four-light dining-room gasalier, the 
brass hoop is perfectly useless, and it obstructs a great deal 
of light. Such a design, though a revival of a Gothic form, 
is contrary to the spirit of the style. 

It is seldom that architecture has founded itself strictly 
on constructive necessities, using only such ornament as 
grew naturally out of the construction and thus explained 
and enforced it. The human mind moves so slowly, and 
clings to old habits so long, that for centuries after a nation 
has given up wood construction, we find it copying wooden 
forms in stone buildings. In the gateways of Hindoo Topes, 
of one of which there is a reproduction in the South 
Kensington Museum, enormous trouble and expense has 
been taken to procure posts and cross-bars of stones like 
long logs of wood ; and of course the nail-heads, which in 
wooden construction fastened the logs, are carefully carved 
in the stone. Even in Greek architecture, the triglyphs 
which divide the frieze into spaces are said to be the remi- 
niscence of the notched ends of the wooden beams of the 
roof. The decoration of Roman architecture has nothing 
to do with its construction, but is the artistic expression of 
a wholly different one. In fact, the history of all arts and 
ornament consists very much in tracing ornamental forms 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 175 

back to some long-forgotten use which gave rise to them. 
Illustrations without end might be given, but the following 
are as good as any. The holes arranged in waves and 
zigzags on the toe-caps of shooting-boots are a reminiscence 
of the old Highland brogues of untanned leather, which 
allowed the water to soak through them, and consequently 
had to be provided with little holes at the toes, where it 
squirted out again with the pressure of each step. Again, 
the bands on the backs of books have similarly now no 
constructive use, except in some of the best-bound books, 
in which they still cover the cords to which the pages are 
sewed. Such features in an art are not unnatural ; on the 
contrary they are analogous to the imperfectly developed 
organs of animals, which performed functions in the 
ancestors of the species, now superseded from change of 
habit, and development of the organism. 

Tn the later stages of Gothic architecture the same 
tendency shows itself. The Gothic house at Boppart, 
illustrated on the next page, shows a common mode of forti- 
fying mediaeval houses, by projecting turrets at the angles 
hung out on corbels, with openings at the bottom, from 
which stones and molten lead could be thrown down on 
assailants. 

In the Nassauer House, at Nuremberg (fig. 50), there are 
similar turrets at the angles, which are useless for defence. 
They have no openings at the bottom through which missiles 
might be hurled. Nor do they fulfil any other purpose of 
use or convenience. They are purely ornamental ; but I 
feel thankful to the architect for putting them there. Their 
beauty, and the character they give to the building, is to me 
sufficient justification for their existence. 

Modern Gothic shows the same tendency. In the new 
Gothic Hotel at St. Pancras Station, which is a splendid 
example of the style, it cannot be said that the specially 
Gothic features, such as the pointed windows filled with 






170

tracery, are the outcome of any modern hotel requirements. 
Pointed windows are inconvenient for blinds and curtain* 
and reduce the light at the top where it is of most valu&lt; 
for lighting the room. The tracery still further obstructs 




Fig. 50. 



THE NASSAUEU HOUSE AT NUREMBERG. 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 179 

it, and it is scarcely sufficient justification for it that the 
circles in it are utilised as ventilators. 

The beauty of the architecture may be sufficient com- 
pensation for the inconvenience and expense which the use 
of the style involves, but when applied to modern domestic 
use it has not the justification which has been claimed 
for it, that its features are the outcome of use and con- 
venience. 

To the earlier development of the old Gothic architecture 
belongs the almost singular merit of perfect truthfulness. 
When a form ceased to have meaning, it was frankly given 
up ; people did not, as in most other styles, weakly cling 
to the dead carcass. Instead of the ignorance and 
darkness usually attributed to the Middle Ages, there 
is a freshness and independence of thought rare in the 
history of humanity, and a wealth of artistic conception 
employed in making every new necessity beautiful, which 
few races have possessed. If we could but do likewise, the 
result of working on the principles of Gothic architecture 
would be something very different from pointed Gothic. 
We should have no pointed windows, and quatrefoils, and 
buttresses which receive no thrust. We should not have 
in stone-work chamfer-stops, at the angles of windows, 
simulating wooden framed work ; arid all sorts of ugly 
and unmeaning notchings ; and roofs so steep, that they 
endanger men's lives. 1 We should ruthlessly abandon 
unsuitable forms, not developed by our modern neces- 
sities, even though we admire them for their beauty. 
Can it be said that the Gothic revival has exhibited 
these signs of the true Gothic spirit? On the whole, 
certainly not ; and we fear that such vices as appear 
in it are almost inseparable from the attempt to apply 
a thirteenth-century style to nineteenth-century use ; that 

1 In old buildings these steep roofs had usually a parapet at the cornice, which 
saved any workman, slipping on them, from falling over the wall.

the Gothic style is, in fact, the artistic expression of an obsolete 
mode of construction. 

As a matter of fact the attempt to introduce Gothic as 
the style for our domestic architecture has failed. The 
instances in which there has been any serious endeavour to 
build Gothic houses have been rare, and in these the style 
has shown itself as an external application of ornament 
not demanded by the necessities of convenience and con- 
struction. Under a pointed vault a pointed arch gives 
more light, but under a level ceiling it diminishes the 
light where it is of most value for lighting the room, not only 
by cutting away the corners at the top of the window and 
leaving useless spandrils (fig. 42 page 152), but by filling the 
window head with stone tracery, which not only blocks out 
light but is inconvenient for opening, and unsuitable for 
roller blinds. Hence pointed windows are not insisted on 
in modern Gothic, and when they are gone there is not 
much of the style left ; for, in the mode of construction 
and the internal fittings of houses, the Gothic revival has 
had little or no influence. In most Gothic parsonages and 
mansions (except in some rare instances where the funds at 
command have permitted the expense of vaulted halls), 
walls and roofs, ceilingg, floors, and windows are made in 
the ordinary way. Sometimes the architect, aiming at 
perfect truthfulness of construction, has left the brick-work 
unplastered, though that was not the practice in old Gothic ; 
or has omitted the plaster ceiling of the rooms, leaving the 
joists visible, or substituting wooden boarding instead, 
making the floor less sound proof, and greatly increasing the 
risk from fire. But usually the common traditional construc- 
tion is adopted, with Gothic details and ornament, wherever 
is opportunity of using them. These opportunities are rare ; 
for the peculiarities of Gothic detail spring from stone con- 
struction, and it is difficult to express them in the wood and 
plaster fittings of our modern houses. 



GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 181 

Plaster cornices and ornament, which give an air of 
finish to our commonest modern houses, were unknown in 
Gothic, as was also the modern system of wood panelling 
in doors and shutters, till the style had passed into its 
later forms. The Perpendicular style ornamented the sur- 
face of panels with patterns like folds of linen, but this was 
too expensive for common use. The modern system of 
ornamenting panels by moulded slips of wood planted 
round the edge grew up under Classic influence and 
took Classic forms, and its use takes away the Gothic 
character from the house. For churches and for the out- 
side doors of halls the panelling could be dispensed with. 
These might be made simply of planks or boards, and hung 
like old Gothic ones on iron hooks fixed in the stone. But 
the better fitting, and the avoidance of warping and 
shrinking which panelling secures, could not be dispensed 
with for inside work. It was consequently used without 
mouldings, the edges of the styles or framework in which 
it was fixed being merely chamfered. Hence arises an 
appearance of coarseness and poverty in the interiors of 
modern Gothic houses, a want of finish, which even the 
cheaper Classic houses possess. 

Our common sash windows, which open by the two 
sashes hung by cords and weights sliding one past the 
other, have proved a difficulty to modern Gothic, never 
rightly got over. This kind of window, which came to us, 
I believe, with Dutch William, is now a part of our English 
constitution, and, during the thirty years of the Gothic 
revival, architects have been trying to work it into the 
style. It was absurd in a pointed window to let the top sash 
down, for a pointed frame was an awkward shape to fit, and 
the air space left when the sash was pulled down was of a 
most unconstructional form for wood- work, something like 
an arrow head. Sometimes no attempt was made to fit it 
to the pointed forms. It was set well back from the face of 



182 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

the wall, and the Gothic shaft and tracery put in front of it 
for ornament, like the Classic porticos in last century houses. 
Sometimes it was kept close to the tracery, a stone transom 
concealing the meeting-bars of the stone sashes. In this case 
the different planes of the upper and lower sash gave an 
awkward look, which was got over by making the sashes 
half or a third of the usual thickness, of seasoned oak. But 
these attempts only prove that to use sliding sash windows 
simply and honestly makes the architecture something else 
than Gothic. 

So far, therefore, as truth in architecture is concerned, 
we are forced to admit that Gothic architecture, however 
beautiful it may be, is not the outcome of our modern 
habits and requirements, nor of the traditions and modes of 
work of our workmen. These are practically unaffected by 
the thirty years' crusade waged by our best writers and 
architects and the highest culture at the universities, 
supported by the country's wealth. It seemed at one time 
as if the best talent in painting and sculpture had ranged 
itself on the side of Grothic. Beauties, which for three 
centuries had been unnoticed, were found in the painting of 
the schools before the time of Raphael. Sculptors tried to 
forget what the Greeks had done, and saw, behind the 
imperfect forms of mediaeval sculpture, the intensity and 
earnestness which breathed through them. 

In poetry the subject which fired genius was King 
Arthur's round table and the deeds of his knights, as they 
were seen reflected in mediaeval tales. 

The wave has gone back, but it has quickened and 
revivified art, making it a matter of interest to every one, 
not a dead body of Classic rules, interesting only to the 
learned. Sculptors have returned to their allegiance to 
Greek forms. Pre-Raphaelite pictures are no longer painted. 
The great masters of the Renaissance are again the highest 
models. But the artists see with their own eyes, as they 






GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. 183 

would not have done if they had not worked in the same 
school as that from which the Renaissance painters sprung. 

In domestic architecture the tide is turning. Since I 
wrote these sentences six years ago, the change in feeling 
has been rapid. But we cannot go back to the dead Classic, 
from which Gothic was a reaction. The spirit and life 
which it has left us need freer forms for their expression. 

I say nothing here about the architecture of churches. 
Gothic may still be the best expression of their purposes, 
since it was developed in building them. If so, the 
problem is not solved of finding a style which, like old ones, 
might be universal. Architecture cannot reach its highest 
development in merely utilitarian buildings, when it lacks 
the force of religious enthusiasm. But the practical evil 
of having separate styles for churches and for houses is not 
serious. Gothic has not failed in churches, for it has perfect 
models to follow, and no new wants to satisfy. 

Churches too are simpler in their purposes, and can more 
easily be superintended throughout by an architect. In the 
greater number of our houses we are dependent on the work- 
man ; his ideas and capacities must in many points limit our 
art. To get art on these terms in our houses is an advance 
and a gain, for hitherto our houses, unlike churches, have 
been almost wholly outside its domain. 

What little influence Gothic has had on ordinary house 
architecture has been deleterious. When set free from the 
well established laws which regulate it in churches, it lends 
itself with fatal facility to the expression of ignorance and 
ostentation, and, instead of architecture governed by beauty 
and refinement, produces masses of crude forms inspired 
only by unrest, loudness, and vulgarity. Better far the 
monotony of Gower Street. That at least does not cry 
out continually, " Come look at me." If it is dull it is at 
least quiet and unobtrusive. If not clever it is sensible 
and practical, for the workmen understood what they were 



184

doing. It is plain prose, while " fast " Gothic is hysteri- 
cal sensational poetry, bristling with vulgarity and bad 
grammar. It is not understood by those who have to work 
in it, and the more it spreads the more is this apparent. 
After thirty years of careful tending the plant has not 
taken root in the soil.

CHAPTER VI. 



GREEK ARCHITECTURE. 



MONGr the styles of architecture which remain after 
eliminating all which were unsuitable for our use, 
as neither understood nor practised, we included Greek. 

Till lately Greek architecture was unknown. It was 
known that Greek buildings existed, but they were in- 
cluded along with Roman ones under the general designation 
of " Classic.'* The publication in the end of last century, of 
Stuart and Revett's careful measurements and delineations 
of Greek buildings, in their ' Antiquities of Athens,' made 
evident the great divergence in form, and the essential 
difference in spirit between the two styles of architecture, 
and the immense superiority in beauty of line of the 
mouldings and ornament and refinement of the Greek, of 
which it was seen that the Roman was only a bad copy. 
Our possession of the Elgin Marbles created an enthusiasm 
for Greek art, and about fifty years ago every new building 
of importance was designed in the style. The most notable 
attempts are St. Pancras Church ; the unfinished National 



186 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 




Monument at Edinburgh, and St. George's Hall at Liver- 
pool. But the influence of the style permeated all archi- 
tecture, and in every builder's house of the period we find 

attempts at Greek mouldings 
in the wooden doors, and 
enfeebled copies of the orna- 
ments of the Parthenon in the 
plaster work. 

Greek architecture grew in 
building temples. These con- 
sisted of an enclosed shrine, 
the dwelling of the god the 
naos or temple proper and 
porticos or sheds surround- 
ing it, for the accommodation 
of the worshippers, formed by 
prolonging the temple roof 
beyond the walls and sup- 
porting it on columns. As 
these porticos were the visible 
part of the building, they 
determined the nature of 
Greek architecture, which

THESEUS, ATHENS. 

consisted of stone columns 

supporting a roof, on which rested the architrave, great 
stone lintels from column to column. On it were placed 
the beams of the roof. The tri glyphs with their notched 
ends (fig. 52) are said to be a reminiscence in the stone 
construction of the older wooden beams. These with the 
spaces between them, which were generally ornamented with 
sculpture in relief, are called the frieze ; above them is 
the cornice, the crowning member, projected to throw off 
the wet, the raindrops hanging from its underside, being 
still represented, petrified into stone. 

The ground idea of Greek architecture is weight ad&lt;

quately supported. It is a very simple idea. Some, like 
Mr. Buskin and Mr. William Morris, hardly allow it to 
be architecture at all. A child or a savage can set up 
two stones and rest a third on the top of them. This 
primitive idea the Greeks held to with religious venera- 
tion, retaining every traditional form of it as sacred, 
even copying in stone the ends 
of the wooden beams of the 
earlier temples. This gives no 
ground for imagining as is some- 
times done that the columns and 
lintels were once of wood. One 
may have a roof of wood on a 
stone building, and the form of 
the Doric column is certainly a 
tradition of ruder stone form. 
The square stone slab or abacus, 
resting on the capital, is no imita- 
tion of anything wooden. Its 
earliest examples are the most 
massive, and they would not have 
been so had they been imitations 
of wooden buildings. The Ionic 
capital perhaps suggests a wooden 

origin; a corbel with its ends rounded, set across a post 
to receive the lintel (fig. 54). 



In Greek architecture there are three orders : the Doric, 
the Ionic, and the Corinthian. 

The Doric (figs. 52, 53) was simple and massive, but, on 
account of its simplicity of form, it exhibits all the more 
clearly the proportion between the weight and its supports, 
which is perfectly adjusted. In the Parthenon the lines of 
every part are -drawn with exquisite delicacy and refinement. 
None are quite straight, but all, not merely the columns

OF APOLLO AT DELOS. 



188 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

but the walls and the steps, are gentle curves. There is no 
ornament in the architecture ; nothing to interrupt the idea 
of great stones, each doing its work of supporting or being 
supported. Everything that might be called ornament is 
with a view to this end. The building stands on a platform 
of three steps so solid looking that the columns require no 
bases. The capitals are mere projections, their delicate 
curves indicating support of the mass above them. Their 
entases and flutings give them grace and ease in supporting 
the weight of the architrave, which remains merely a square 
stone. The triglyphs and the guttce, or petrified raindrops, 
indicate the downward pressure of the entablature. 

The temple at Paestum in the Greek colony of Magna 
Graecia, fig. 20, p. 56, is a magnificent specimen of the order. 
Whether because it is provincial work ; or, possibly, because 
it is of earlier date, the style is ruder than at Athens ; 
the capitals are more massive and have less refinement of 
line, . but this does not detract from the grandeur of the, 
architecture. 

The Ionic (figs. 54 and 55) was lighter and more graceful 
in its proportions than the Doric, having the same relation 
to it in its proportions as a woman to a man. There is no 
doubt that, as its name implies, it is Asiatic in its origin, 
and that the spiral corners of the capital are a tradition 
of architectural forms of the ancient Asiatic monarchies. 
Representations of rude Ionic capitals are found in the 
Assyrian sculptures ; and in ancient Persian architecture 
the capitals have Ionic volutes placed not across the top, 
but attached perpendicularly to the side. 1 The Greeks 
took the form and gave it new meaning and grace. These 
spiral curves of the Ionic capital may seem unmeaning. It 
is not the form which naturally suggests itself for support, 
but it is beautiful in itself, and it gives to the capital

189 



an impression of spring and elasticity. These two orders 
were used simultaneously by the Greeks. They are not 
successive developments of different ages, like the styles 
of Gothic architecture. Nor were they confined like 
national styles to districts of their own. One of the most 
splendid examples of the Corinthian order is the temple of 
Jupiter Olympus, at Athens, and one of the oldest and most

remarkable examples of Doric is at Corinth, where no 
specimens of the Corinthian order now remain. 

The proportions of these orders were not fixed by un- 
alterable rules according to the " Classic " idea. The 
order of the Erechtheum (fig. 54) is about nine diameters 
high; that of the temple on the Ilissus (fig. 55), about 
seven and a half, the weight to be supported being 



190 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



more massive and simpler. Both are right, the various 
parts of the architecture being made to harmonise in their 
proportions. 

The Corinthian is rather a Roman, than a Greek order, 
the examples of it which occur in Greece having been 
erected under its Roman masters. It is par-excellence the 
Roman order; they loved it for its magnificence and

sumptuousness. In it spiral volutes, springing from a crown 
of acanthus leaves which surrounds the bell of the capital, 
mask the junction between the round bell and the corners 
of the abacus ; which is not square in plan, as in the Doric, 
but hollowed in the centre and projecting at the angles. 

We all know the story about the discovery of the 
Corinthian Capital, told in every treatise on the Orders, from 



GREEK ARCHITECTURE. 



191 



Vitruvius downwards, how a basket (shaped like those we 
use as waste-paper baskets), covered with a square tile or 
" abacus," having been left beside an acanthus plant, the 
plant climbed up the basket and turned round in spirals 
under the projecting angles of the tile. 

The forms of architecture seemed to the ancients so 
immutable that any change in them seemed to them to 
need a special interposition. 

But the Corinthian capital may be _. ._ 

accounted for by the ordinary process of 
natural development. The capitals at 
the angles in the Ionic order (see figs. 54 
and 55, page 183) had spirals on each face, 
unlike the intermediate capitals of the 
range, which had the spirals only on the 
front and back faces. The two meeting 
spirals at each corner of the capital 

deseed into a horn supporting the 
)rner of the abacus. 

The ornament round the neck of the 
column seen in the order of the Erech- 
theum (fig. 54, page 189), which was at 
first merely painted, was afterwards 
carved in relief, as in this instance. With 
the desire for greater richness in Roman 
iste, it was merely a natural develop- 
ment to carve this ornament round the 
leek in richly cut leaves in high relief, 
'his process is better seen in what is 
called the Composite order (fig. 58), from its being supposed 

be a union of the Ionic and Corinthian. It is merely a 
ruder form of the latter, in which the spiral horns at the 
corner are more delicate and refined. 

There is no question that the Corinthian capital is more 
logical in form than either the Doric or Ionic. So far it is

ORDER. ARCH OF 
SEPT1M1US SEVERUS 
ROME. 



192 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

an advance and improvement. It is natural that the 
capital should expand to receive the weight ; the Doric 
capital so expands, but leaves the corners of the abacus 
unsupported. The form of expansion in the Ionic is not 
that suggested by the function which it has to perform. 
But the Corinthian capital carries the line of support, in the 
simplest and most natural manner, from the round of the 
column up to the square of the abacus. 

It has continued the normal type of capital ever since, 
through the Byzantine and Gothic styles ; often beautifully 
modified ; birds and animals being substituted for the 
spiral horns to support the corners of the abacus. 

It may appear as if Greek architecture judged by tin 
test of being at present understood and practised might 
have been passed over as unsuitable for our use ; that 
the enthusiasm for the style among highly educated 
persons, which followed the publication of Stuart and 
Revett's ' Antiquities of Athens,' and our possession and 
appreciation of the Elgin Marbles, had passed away ; 
that no one would think now of building a church like 
St. Pancras, or of attempting a reproduction of the Par- 
thenon, like the unfinished National Monument on the 
Calton Hill in Edinburgh. The style required special 
knowledge and learning for understanding it, and was 
never generally appreciated. As practised with us, it was 
cold and formal ; and, as there were very few specimens 
to copy from and only the most perfect of these were 
followed, there was a weary sameness in the results. The 
sculpture which had given life and interest to the original 
was omitted ; colour was thought vulgar ; and the general 
impression of one of those Doric porticos in our climate, 
in any weather, but especially in an east wind with sleet 
driving through it, was dismal arid depressing. 

The style had also the serious practical disadvantage for 




GREEK ARCHITECTURE. 193 

our climate, that windows were supposed to be inadmissible. 
As it was impossible wholly to dispense with them, they 
were ignored, like vulgar intruders in good society, and 
treated as if no one was expected to look at them, as plain 
holes cut in the] wall, without any ornament or moulding 
whatever. This of course, only made them more painfully 
conspicuous. Smuggled in between columns, and cutting 
up what should have been their solid background of wall, 
they became vulgar and objectionable. 

These mistakes, however, do not prove that Greek 
architecture is unfitted for our domestic purposes ; for they 
arose from too slavish adherence to a very limited number 
of copies, all of which were from temples built for purposes 
wholly different from our civil buildings or houses. 

In Greek temples like the Parthenon, only about half 
the space under the roof is enclosed. All the rest is open, 
merely a roof supported on pillars ; the object being to 
provide the worshippers with shade, shelter from cold not 
being needed. The enclosed part, the dwelling of the 
god, was more sacred ; its solid walls a painted background 
for the white columns. To attempt to adapt forms re- 
sulting from an arrangement like this, to modern domestic 
or municipal purposes, could only result in failure. It 
showed little appreciation of Greek art to imagine that 
this was following it ; but temples being the only build- 
ings remaining, no other course was open to copiers, who 
as usual, in zeal for form, managed to miss the spirit. 
They could not see that for every different purpose the 
Greeks had a different form ; that pains were taken to 
make buildings, whose uses were not the same, dissimilar ; 
to place them on different levels, and even change the archi- 
tecture, though they formed all part of the same group or 
even of the same building. All this they might have 
seen, had they only had eyes, in the Erechtheum (fig. 59, 

VOL. i. o 



194 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



which is really more varied in its outline and more pur- 
posely irregular than any Gothic church. Being three 
temples, the architect did not see why he should make 
it look like one ; and so he has made the architecture of 
each different. So also when two buildings were near one 
another, the Greeks avoided placing them at right angles 
or in right line. They saw no reason for destroying by

perpetual straight lines and right angles all variety and 
play of shadow, as we do in our modern streets. 

Nor has Greek ornament the frigid dull cast-iron character 
which any one who had only seen the reproductions of 
it in modern work would suppose. It has the same free- 
hand irregularity and variety as Gothic ornament, but the 






GREEK ARCHITECTURE. 195 



copiers thought to improve on the original hy reducing 
everything to dead sameness. 

Some reproductions of Greek architecture, notably the 
High School at Edinburgh, appreciated this adaptability 
and variety of the style ; but all are cold and formal, and 
rather depressing in their effect, and they must be utterly 
unlike in character to what, for lighter domestic purposes, 
the " merry Greeks " themselves produced. 

Their domestic architecture has perished ; from the re- 
mains of Pompeii, in the Greek colony of Mngna Grsecia, 
we have an idea of the decoration of their houses in the 
Litest times, but of their external architecture few traces are 
left. It must be a libel on their taste to suppose that it at 
all resembled that which they emplo}*ed in the temples, in 
form or solemn character, or in anything except grace and 
beauty, arid suitableness to its own purpose. 

There is an antique bass-relief in the British Museum 
representing the visit of Bacchus to Tcarius. The back- 
ground is formed by the house, which has simple windows 
with a square pillar in the centre of each, dividing it like 
a mullion ; a low pitched roof covered with tiles, but no 
portico for mere ornament, in imitation of a temple, as in 
our Classic houses of last century. 

The appreciation of this practical common sense, which 
characterised the domestic architecture of the old Greeks, 
has lately given rise in France to what is called the 
Neogrec or new Greek style, in which some houses and 
villas have been built in Paris, characterised by grace 
and elegance, the architects showing such a knowledge of 
Greek art that they dare use it with freedom. 

Glasgow possesses some examples, due to the genius of 
the late Alexander Thomson, of a treatment of Greek archi- 
tecture characterised by great freedom and originality, and 
appreciation of its severer beauties, if not of its playfulness 
and lighter elegancies. He had few chances of showing 

02 



196 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

his power, but everything he designed, even common 
houses for building speculators, has an unmistakable stamp 
of genius and originality. His enthusiasm for art, and his 
unswerving allegiance to it, which made him reject any 
personal advantages at the cost of what he believed to be 
right, have left their influence, and have raised the character 
of the architecture of the city. 

So far, therefore, as our second condition of FREEDOM is 
concerned, no exception can be taken to the use of Greek 
in domestic architecture. Symmetry and regularity were 
not thought essential. Irregularity is admissible, indeed 
is enjoined, when it arises naturally and truthfully from 
the purposes of the building. Windows may be large or 
small, as occasion requires ; and the style is even flexible 
enough to adopt some mode of dividing windows, probably 
by means of slender pillars and cornices, which would serve 
the purposes of mullions and transom in carrying the 
architecture across wider openings. 

Some hold that architecture, properly so called, did not 
exist for the Greeks ; that it was first invented by the 
Romans, when they discovered the arch and developed it in 
vaulting ; that before this it no more existed than the 
modern sciences did before, the time of Bacon ; that, though 
whatever the Greeks did they did well, their architecture 
is only a refinement of Stonehenge, setting up two long 
stones arid laying a third on the top of them. 

Certainly, now that we know the arch, it would be an 
impossible folly to reject the use of it in pur houses, for 
it would deprive us of the use of bricks and small stories 
for bridging over openings, causing needless expense, and 
depriving us of many charming effects which those who 
have gone before us have taught us. But to adopt the 
arch in Greek architecture would be carrying freedom so 
far as to abolish the style altogether. 

As regards our third condition its SUITABLENESS TO OUR 



GREEK ARCHITECTURE. 197 

HIGHEST ART more could be said in its favour now than 
would have been possible a few years ago. Our sculpture, 
indeed, has always looked to Greek art as its highest model, 
and would easily adopt its forms. Of late years pro- 
minent artists like Leighton, Poynter, and Albert Moore, 
have painted Classical subjects in a G-reek manner, and the 
tendency seems to be growing ; but the great mass of our 
art is out of its influence, and it will probably continue to 
be admired and practised only by a few. 

It cannot be objected to the style, that it would be 
impossible or even difficult to find suitable furnishing for 
it. Since Wedgwood's days, pottery and ornaments have 
affected its forms ; and in general furnishing the style of 
the first French Empire, or the Classic delicacy of the time 
of Queen Anne, which still linger among us, are not 
unsuitable to it. But while we may expect to see Greek 
art crop out occasionally in architecture and painting, as 
well as in sculpture, there is no reasonable prospect of its 
ever being generally adopted in this country. It may be 
the highest and purest style, but Guinevere preferred 
Lancelot to the stainless Arthur, and it may be too high 
and pure for us. It has high merits, but most people can- 
not see them. It is not popular, and is even hated for its 
strangeness. 

Nor would any one who really loved it wish to see it in 
the hands of ordinary builders, or of the mass of architects. 
The result would be even worse than the vulgarising of 
Gothic, for its beauties are more delicate and refined. It 
is as little a natural expression of our nature as of that of 
the Romans, who, though they professed to admire, and 
attempted to copy it, spoiled it in their reproductions. Its 
main influence on them was to delay them for some 
centuries in developing a true style for themselves, and 
the chances are that the attempt to adopt it would have 
a similar influence on us. 



108

Although, therefore, its merits and its capacity of adapta- 
tion to our domestic wants are greater than in the specimens 
we have heen accustomed to see, any attempts to revive it- 
will be isolated and without general result. The nation 
must change before it can comply with our first test of 
suitableness some prospect of its general adoption, 



CLASSICAL OR RENAISSANCE ARCHITECTURE. 199 



CHAPTER VII. 



CLASSICAL OR RENAISSANCE ARCHITECTURE. 



IN answering the question as to what style of architecture 
is best suited for our houses, it only remains for us to 
consider the various styles which are included under the 
general name of Classical architecture ; all influenced more 
or less by the enthusiasm for Classical literature, and for 
old Roman art, which, under the name of the Renaissance 
or Revival (from the supposed darkness of the Middle 
Ages), sprung up in Italy in the fifteenth century, and has 
become part of all modern civilisation. 

The memory of the old Roman Imperial power, which the 
barbarians destroyed, influenced the whole period of the 
Middle Ages. The law and order, and the civilisation which 
Charlemagne established was an attempt to revive the rule 
of the Roman Caesar. The monasteries preserved the litera- 
ture of Rome, and continued the traditions of its architecture. 

In the thirteenth century there was an earlier Renaissance 
within the limits of the Middle Ages, 1 which showed itself 

1 Sec Pater's ' Studies in the History of the Renaissance.' London. Mac- 
mil Ian &amp; Co. 1873. 



200 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

in the Verse of Dante and of the Troubadours ; and in 
Gothic architecture, which was the logical development of 
the Roman vault and arch. 

" The word Renaissance," Mr. Pater says, " is now 
generally used to denote not merely that revival of classical 
antiquity which took place in the fifteenth century, and to 
which the word was first applied, but a whole complex 
movement, of which that revival of classical antiquity was 
but one element or symptom. For us the Renaissance is 
the name of a many-sided but yet united movement, in 
which the love of the things of the intellect and the 
imagination for their own sake, the desire for a more liberal 
and comely way of conceiving life, make themselves felt, 
prompting those who experience this desire to seek first one 
and then another means of intellectual or imaginative en- 
joyment, and directing them not merely to the discovery 
of old and forgotten sources of this enjoyment, but to divine 
new sources of it, new experiences, new subjects of poetry, 
new forms of art. Of this feeling there was a great out- 
break in the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the 
following century." 

In the fifteenth century when the Classic traditions, which 
had vegetated in the Eastern Empire since the time of Con- 
stantine, were driven by the conquest of Constantinople to 
the "West, they burst into new life in the fresh soil of the 
vigorous Western nations. The new learning brought them 
light and life : their past efforts in literature and philosophy 
seemed gropings in the dark. Even the old pagan worship 
of Nature with its unrestrained enjoyment of life and 
beauty, which Christianity and asceticism had for centuries 
been suppressing, found sympathisers in cultivated minds and 
in the high places of the Church. Some enthusiasts even 
revived Roman manners, holding banquets lasting several 
days, reclining on couches, dressed like old Romans. 

When such a spirit prevailed it was inevitable that 



\;i 

;: 



CLASSICAL OR RENAISSANCE ARCHITECTURE. 201 

Classic architecture should revive. This Revival or Re- 
naissance came first in Italy. As the intellectual centre 
of the world she was the first to be influenced by the 
new learning, and in architecture she had no vigorous 
native school of Gothic to oppose to the new spirit. For 
in Italy Gothic architecture had never properly taken 
root. It was there an exotic imported from the North; 
a copy of the form without the spirit. In the brighter 
Southern climate it developed a richness of colour and 
softness of form of its own, but it lost the nerve and vigour 
of the native Northern style. Italian Gothic always re- 
mained somewhat Classic in character. The capitals were 
a modification of Corinthian; the columns were generally 
cylinders, like Classic ones, not divided into a number of 
little shafts as in the true Northern style. In Italy the 
ancient Classic buildings, many of which remained pre- 
served from destruction as stone quarries by being utilised as 
churches and castles and possibly also the old traditions of 
orkmanship l kept alive the seeds of Classic architecture, 
n drawings by old masters, painters and architects, we 
have evidence that these Roman remains were studied and 
measured with the same interest and precision as Gothic 
urches have been in our own day by young architects. 

Although it was Greek literature which supplied the 
jhief force of the new learning, Greek architecture was un- 

town or at least unnoticed. In Raphael's picture of Paul 
reaching at Athens, the buildings of the Acropolis, which 
form the background, are Roman not Greek in style. 

The architecture of old Rome was the representative of 
both Greek and Roman ideas in architecture. Hence it

comers of the Abruzzi, workmen who inherited the tradition and the skill of

became Classic, the standard of right ; and buildings 
were admirable in proportion as they conformed to its 
rules. These rules were at first uncertain, for the ancient 
buildings themselves varied in their proportions, but they 
soon became systematised and absolutely fixed. Purity was 
conformity with these rules ; aberrations from them were 
sins against art. 

The Romans seem to have been unconscious of the 
artistic value of their own inventions in architectural 
construction. To them we owe the use of the arch, the 
inventions of vaulting and of the dome, and the practice of 
placing one story above another. These are such wonderful 
advances in architecture, that it may be fairly said the art 
did not previously exist. All that the Greeks had done 
in construction was to rest a long stone or lintel on the top 
of two upright supports. Whatever they did they did 
well, but it was no great thing to do. The arch revolu- 
tionised architecture. It created a new art, the name of 
which is derived from the new mode of construction. The 
form of the arch is found in primitive constructions, in 
which a space is covered over by successive layers of stones 
laid on a flat bed, each projecting beyond that below it, the 
top layers meeting and resting against each other, which 
prevents them toppling in. This mode of construction is a 
succession of corbels, not a true arch, in which the principle 
of stability is quite different. In the arch the stones, each 
cut into a wedge shape, are laid one above the other on a 
wooden ring or centering till the top stone, called the 
&lt; closer" or " key stone," unites the stones rising from each 
side. The centering may then be removed, for the wedge- 
shape of each stone prevents it from falling in, But each 
stone by its weight and by the weight of any wall it carries 
acts like a wedge, tending to split the arch open ; their 
united weight tending to thrust out the lowest stones or 
" springers " on each side, and the walls or pillars on which 



CLASSICAL OR RENATSSAXCE ARCHITECTURE. 203 

these rest, and also the arch stones immediately above the 
springers, for, as these rest partly on their sides, they do not 
act with the same force as wedges as the upper stones which 
press with their whole weight downwards. The arch will 
fall if it widens enough to let any one stone slip through. 
The springers and a few of the arch stones above them must 
therefore be kept in their places, which is done by placing 
against them a mass of masonry called the " abutment " of 
such weight that its resistance is greater than the outward 
thrust of the arch. 

Wherever the arch was invented, the Romans were 
the first to see and make use of its enormous advantages 
in building construction. Lintel construction could span 
spaces only a few feet wide, and to do this required large 
stones difficult to procure. By the use of the arch the 
whole width of great buildings could be spanned by means 
of small stones, or even of bricks. 

The Vault, which the Romans invented, is only a widened 
arch. An arch is the width of the wall it carries, a vault is 
an arched covering of a building. The Dome, which was also 
a Roman invention, is a vault covering a circular building. 
The springers instead of being straight in plan, as in the 
vault and arch, are each a portion of the circle which forms 
the circumference of the building. Each ring in a dome is 
an arch laid horizontal, and its arch-stones are wedge-shaped 
on four sides, not on two only as in the simple arch. It needs, 
therefore, no key-stone to complete it, but may be left off at 
the height of any completed ring, as in the Pantheon ; whose 
only window is a circular opening thirty feet wide left in the 
apex. 

The great civic buildings of the Romans under the empire 
gave splendid scope for the employment of these new inven- 
tions in arched construction. The Greeks had not needed 
such buildings. The assemblies of the people for politics and 
games, and even their courts of justice, were held in the open 



204 



HOUSE AKCHITECTTJRE. 



air. Their houses were simple. Their great buildings were 
their temples in which they adhered religiously to old forms. 
The Roman Laths had great halls, the rendezvous of an idle 
people ; which gave magnificent opportunity for vaulted and 
domed ceilings ; and their courts of justice or basilicas, at 
first uncovered courts surrounded by arcades, were in later 
times covered in by vaults. 

But when the Romans first began to carry out this 
arched construction which they had invented, they showed 

the mastery which the Greeks 

whom they had conquered had 
over them as artists. They 
seemed to feel that their arched 
buildings could have no place 
in art unless they possessed 
the essential features of Greek 
architecture the columns 
with the mass of stone or 
lintel which they supported. 
They therefore added the 
Greek architecture as an orna- 
ment to their own, putting it 
as a covering or screen over 
their arched construction, 
which was seen through the 
spaces formed by the columns 
and lintel. The Arch of 
Hadrian at Athens (fig. 60) 
is an early example of this 

combination, in which, however, the parts are awkwardly 
put together. 1 The practice of later times especially of 
the Renaissance architects, produced more harmony be- 
tween the parts, though the idea is at best a make-shift 

1 For the use of this and of the other illustrations of the Classic orders, taken from 
Rickman's * Gothic Architecture,' I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. James Parker 
of Oxford.

and can never produce a result perfectly satisfactory. The 
Colosseum at Rome (fig. 21, page 59, in a former chapter) 
is a magnificent example of this treatment, though our 
drawing does not fully show this, as it is intended rather 
to give an idea of the mass and grandeur of the building 
than of its details. 

The illustration of the old Roman gate called the Porta 
Nigra, or black gate, at Treves (fig. 62), gives some 
idea of this characteristic of Roman architecture. With 
the revival of Classic architecture this feature was re- 
vived, and to 
the present 
day it con- 
tinues a fav- 
ouritemeansof 
giving splen- 
dour to Classic 
buildings. It 
was employed 
in the Venetian 
palaces (see 
illustrations of 
Vandra- 
mini palace, 
fig. 71, page 
228, and of the 

Cornaro and Pesaro palaces, figs. 72 and 74, pp. 230 and 234) ; 
frequently in France, as at Versailles ; and in England, as in 
the lower story of the little building at King's Lynn, illus- 
trated in fig. 61. But in this case as in many others, instead 
of round pillars against the wall, we have what are called 
pilasters, merely flat projections on the wall, with base and 
capital-like pillars. The pillars were ornamental, they did 
no work ; they were expensive and necessitated great thick- 
ness of wall. A similar effect was obtained at much less cost

208

by flat projections. The expedient had the sanction of ancient 
authority (see Roman capital carved in brick, fig. 63), and is 
a part of Classic architecture. Mr. Fergussori considers it the 
special curse of modern architecture ; if he were Chancellor 
of the Exchequer he would put a tax on every pilaster. But 
it is a simple and ready means of giving proportion arid 
effect to buildings, by supplying perpendicular lines, as 
cornices and strings give horizontal lines, and I do not see 

why we should be deprived 
of it. 

In another way the 
columns and lintels of 
Greek architecture were 
used to impart the element 
of art to Roman buildings. 
The gable-end of the 
Greek temple, which con- 
sists (see fig. 20, p. 56, 
Temple at Paestum, and 
fig. 52, page 186) of a 
portico formed of pillars 
supporting a flat triangular 
gable or pediment, was 
stuck on as an ornamental 
porch to a Roman building, 
as in the Pantheon at Rome. 
In England in the eighteenth century such porticos were 
stuck on the front of every house with any pretence to 
architecture, often on an upper story, where they could have 
no meaning as a porch. Fig. 64 shows an early specimen 
of this treatment in this country by Inigo Jones. 

Such uses of the Greek sytsem of construction showed in 
the Romans a want of fine artistic perception ; but it was 
the natural outcome of their character and circumstances,

and it produced grand and magnificent results. It was 
eminently practical ; and utilised admirably the capacities of 
the various nations who were under their rule and did their 
work. The walls and vaults and simple masses of their 
buildings could be constructed by ordinary slave labour 
properly directed, while the skill of the Greeks in art was 
employed to decorate them with mouldings and carved 
capitals and statues in marble. The result, though it had

not the perfect refinement of Greek art, was admirable in its 
own way. It is a different kind of glory from the glory of 
Greek architecture a lower kind sumptuous rather than 
refined. 

Roman architecture tended to work itself clear of the 
extraneous ornaments of Greek columns and lintel. In 
engineering works, such as aqueducts, they had been from

the first dispensed with. In Diocletian's great palace at 
Spalatro, where he retired when he resigned the empire, the 
arch becomes more prominent as an architectural feature. 
In the Church of St. Sophia at Constantinople, built by 
Justinian in the first half of the sixth century, all trace 
of Greek construction, and of " the orders/' has disappeared. 
The architecture consists of arches, vaults, and domes 
appropriately decorated. But this natural 
development, which is a sign of life and 
truth in the architecture, has been counted 
degradation, the result of ignorance and error. 
After describing the splendid marble columns 
of St. Sophia, Gibbon, expressing the opinion 
of his time, adds, " but every order of archi- 
tecture disclaims their fantastic capitals." 1 It 
was left to Gothic architecture under new 
conditions to give a new development to the 
principle of the arch. 

In adopting the Greek orders the Romans 
altered and vulgarised them, bringing them 
better into harmony with their own feelings 
and the use they made of them, giving them 
greater richness and ornament, and less grace 
and delicacy of line. The delicate parabolic 
curve of the capital of the Grecian Doric,

parsimony, but not perceiving their use and 
value, preferring instead of the white marbles of the Greeks, 
richly coloured marbles, whose surface the flutings would 
have spoilt. To the Doric order they added a base, the 

1 We have learnt to see such capitals now with different eyes. They are full of 
beauty and variety. The carving of their acanthus leaves is Greek, rather than 
Roman, in spirit and delicacy of line. A similar treatment of capitals is found in 
Gothic buildings of the thirteeth century, especially in France.

want of which is even painfully obvious in the illustration 
(fig. 65) from the Theatre of Marcellus at Rome, as the 
solid base is omitted on which, in Greek architecture, 
the Doric column rests. They lost the Greek proportions, 
elongating the columns, reducing the weight of the en- 
tablature or supported mass, and depriving the architecture 
of its dignity. In their hands the Ionic order was sub-

jected to a similar transformation. It is less severe, the 
columns are slenderer, the entablature of less depth, the 
shadow of the projecting cornice modified by a deep 
moulding supporting it. 

The illustration from the Aqueduct of Hadrian at Athens 
(fig. 66) shows an invention of the Eomans, in combining 
their own arched architecture with the Greek orders, which 

p 2 



212 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



became a feature of Classic and especially of Eenaissance 
architecture. This example is clumsy and imperfect in 
the combination of its parts. In adopting the idea the 
Eenaissance architects carried the whole entablature and 
cornice over the two pillars, and rested the arch on the 
top of the cornice instead of, as in this instance, on the top 
of the architrave. They made the arch much lighter, only 
the width of the architrave. 

In the buildings which the Romans left in Italy and 
elsewhere, the Eenaissance architects believed they found 
five different orders of architecture, and therefore the science 
of architecture had five orders and no more. Besides 
the three orders of the Greeks they found the Tuscan, 
which, as Palladio says, " is the most plain and simple of 
all the orders of architecture, as it retains more of the old 
simplicity, and is devoid of all those ornaments which give 
so great a grace and beauty to the others." l "In it," he 
says, " the intercolumnations may be very wide, because 
the architraves are made of timber." 

In old Eoman practice the treatment and proportions of 
the Orders were by no means fixed, and in the modification 
of the Corinthian, which we have already described, which 
some Eoman architect in the exercise of this liberty had pro- 
duced, was found a new order, the Composite (see page 191, 
fig. 58). Palladio looks on these orders as ultimate facts 
of science. That a new order should be added was as 
impossible as the creation of a new animal. Freart, Sieur 
de Chambray, in Louis Quatorze's time in an interesting 
treatise, " made English for the benefit of builders," by John 
Evelyn, the author of the Diary, goes farther. He refuses 
to address himself to those who pretend that " the mind is

free, not bound, and that we have as good right to invent 
and follow our own Genius, as the Antients, without ren- 
dering ourselves their slaves ; since Art is an infinite thing, 
growing every day to more perfection." " The three orders 
which are derived to us from the Greeks, not only contain 
whatsoever is excellent, but likewise all that is necessary, of 
architecture; there being but three manners of building: 
the solid, the mean (or intermediate), and the delicate" 
He complains that, " we daily behold these orders so 
disfigured and ill-treated by the workmen of this age that, 
to speak seriously, there remains not so much as a single 
member which has not, received some strange and monstrous 
alteration." 

Yet Freart seems to have had no perception that the 
orders, as employed by the best authorities, differed in their 
laracter from Greek architecture ; the faith in their autho- 
*ity was too strong for any such questioning. There was 
&gt;nie doubt as to whether the Doric column should have a 
; the authority of the order of the Theatre of Marcellus 
against it, but the feeling of its necessity prevailed 
dnst authority. The principle of authority checked the 
je development of architecture, in a way unknown in the 
lediaeval styles. The evil was not that the new architec- 
ire was derived from the old. It might have developed 
jely, as one language may develop freely which is derived 
)m another. But the new forms of life which were con- 
tntly springing up were compelled to conform to dead 
lies : and under the force of this compulsion, the style was 
mtinually recurring to the original type. Instead of, as 
would have been the case in a natural growth, becoming 
less like the original, its aberrations were greatest at first; 
just as a school boy's Latin theme is marked at first by 
English idioms, which disappear with his more perfect 
knowledge of classic authorities. 

The absolute authority of the five orders became 



214 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



established about the time that the new opinions of th&lt; 
Renaissance in religion were being crystallised into the 
symbols and standards of the various churches. 

There was an outburst of free thought and natural d&lt; 
velopment, both in architecture and in religion, before this 
result was attained. In both provinces it was condemned and 
as far as possible suppressed by the decrees of the Council 
of Trent and of Protestant synods, as at Dort ; but, in the 
early days of the Renaissance, architecture happily had free 
course. The genius of the great Italians, when they revived 
the ancient architecture, discovered, perhaps unconsciously, 
new proportions. Alberti, Michael Angelo, Palladio and 
other architects, followed different proportions in the orders ; 
and in matters where the guidance of the ancients failed 
them, and they had to trust to their own invention, they 
worked out a new development of style. 

The new learning crossed the Alps carrying with it the 
new architecture, which was accepted as authoritative and 
true. But the native Gothic styles had too much vitality 
to be crushed out by it, and, like conquered peoples, mingled 
with their conquerors. In each country a new style was 
produced which united with the old native the features of 
the new Classic style. The varieties of these styles almost 
defy classification. Each country had its own, and in each 
the style varied according to the strength of the Classical 
knowledge or native habit. To the learned, like Freart or 
Evelyn, they were all abominable; a corruption of pure 
Classic by barbarous admixture. Such men could not see 
that they were natural growths, inevitable in the circum- 
stances, and worthy of study like any other natural 
production. Even living writers have hardly realised this. 
The advocates of Gothic and of Classic have alike abused 
these styles ; but their turn of appreciation has come. 
Correct Classic, asphyxiated by its own rules, had, forty years

ago, become tiresome, almost dead, when a fresh rising of 
the Gothic spirit, the result of the Romantic revival, asserted 
freedom and common sense in architecture. This new 
spirit influenced all the leading thought of the day, and 
the authority of the orders was for ever broken. But the 
wave of the Romantic revival began to ebb. The spirit of 
the Renaissance reasserted itself as the basis of our modern 
ideas and life. Poets felt once more the meaning of the 
worship of Nature and of the old Gods. 

In architecture those who had felt the enthusiasm for 
Gothic, who had drunk in its spirit and had made it a part 
of themselves, awoke to the consciousness that it was not the 
expression of modern ideas, or of the domestic requirements 
of modern life. But they could not return to the thral- 
dom of the Orders, or give up for architecture the right of 
free development, which the Gothic movement had won. 
Trained and formed in Gothic, the spirit of the Renaissance 
coining to them with the force of new truth, they were 
under the same influences as the earliest Renaissance 
architects. They naturally produced work with the same 
characteristics, and found these styles the expression of 
their own state of feeling and models for their work. 
To this stream of tendency, I believe, it is due that these 
early Renaissance styles have again become interesting ; 
the objects of study and the models for modern work. I 
believe it possible that, freed from the obligation to conform 
to the fixed Classic rules, a natural style, the growth of our 
modern wants, may be founded on them. 

From the variety of influences under which these old 
styles were formed, the varieties of them almost defy 
classification. They cannot be arranged chronologically 
like the Medieval Gothic styles, in which the growth 
is regular and the style of each century is similar in each 
country, for the force of the new spirit varied in different 
places at the same time. St. Peter's at Rome ; the Spire of 



216 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



Beauvais ; King's College Chapel, Cambridge ; and Kenais- 
sance buildings in France, were being built at the same 
time, and traces of Gothic continued in England, long after 
Inigo Jones had begun Whitehall. 

It would be altogether beside our purpose to attempt 
a complete account or history of these styles. We shall 
content ourselves with describing some specimens, taken 
very much at random, as they appeared picturesque or 
interesting, or furnished some feature suitable for modern 
use. I have not given illustrations of palaces; those who 
wish to learn about them will find them treated of in Mr. 
Fergusson's book. Our interest is in houses on a scale that 
we might ourselves possibly live in. In such smaller 
houses, the new style had free development, for their 
builders, imperfectly learned in the Classic rules, continued 
old traditions and altered the Orders to suit themselves, 
sometimes with a true feeling and sense of art. Palaces 
were bound to conform to the strictest rules of Classic art 
and therefore have not the variety and suggestiveness of 
less important buildings. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN FLORENCE AND SIENXA. 217 



CHAPTER Till. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN FLORENCE AND SIENNA. 



IN the revival of Classic architecture in Italy, Rome was not 
the leader. Reduced in population and in wealth by 
the faction fights of her nobles, and by the absence of the 
Popes in Avignon, she did not recover sufficiently to erect 
new buildings till the beginning of the sixteenth century. 

The first architects who were touched by the new spirit 
were Florentines. Brunelleschi, who was born in 1377, 
conceived the idea of covering with a dome the crossing of 
the nave and transepts of the cathedral of his native city 
which its Gothic architects had left unfinished, and he 
devoted his life to realise this idea. Going to Rome to 
study the dome of the Pantheon he learned Roman archi- 
tecture and introduced it into his work. Returning to 
Florence he used the new style without a trace of Gothic 
admixture in the churches of San Lorenzo, commenced in 
1425, and San Spirito. 

Albert!, born about 1406, a scholar before he was an 
architect, advanced the movement greatly by his writings. 
He built several churches, as those of St. Francis at Rimini, 
and St. Andrew at Mantua, in perfectly pure Classic. 



218 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

In domestic architecture the change was not so readily 
made, for the old style showed itself long afterwards in 
pointed arches and traceried windows and great rusticated 
stones, which the necessity for strong buildings for defence, 
as well as a feeling for picturesque grandeur, had made a 
characteristic of the old Gothic palaces of Florence. 

In this, as in the recent Gothic movements, the new style 
was used for churches by people, who would never have 
thought of giving up the style for their dwelling-houses they 
had been accustomed to. In the Pitti Palace, commenced by 
Brunelleschi in 1435, the arches are all pointed, and the 
wall is composed of great stones, some of enormous size, 1 
left rough on the surface, though carefully jointed. 

In the Rucellai Palace 2 (which Alberti commenced in 
1460), the roughness of the rustication is toned down, and 
the walls ornamented with pilasters between the arched 
windows, recalling the characteristic feature of the old 
Eoman style; but though the arches have now become 
round, they are still filled with a form of tracery. 

The Nicollini Palace, of which I give an illustration 
(fig. 68), shows an interesting mingling of Gothic and 
Classic features. The outside line of the arches is pointed 
while the opening is round, making the arch stones deepest 
at the top a feature common in Italian Gothic work much 
commended by Mr. Ruskin. Inside these are Classic pilas- 
ters (not properly shown in the cut), supporting round and 
pointed arches. The cornices are Classic, though without 
strict adherence to ancient authority. The loggia at the top, 
a feature which gives much of its charm to Florentine 
architecture, has lent itself perfectly to" Classic forms. 

Mr. Fergusson thinks that this palace is of later date than 
the early period of the transition, and that Bramante may 
have been its architect. More likely it is of the time of 



1 I measured some between 20 and 30 feet long.

219 



Brunelleschi, to whom it is usually attributed, who died the 
year Bramante was born (A.D. 1444), and whose style, as 
shown in the work which it is known he designed, like 
the palace of the Cancelleria at Rome, is quite different in 
character, being fully developed Classic. Judging from the

sections of its mouldings, given in Montigny and Famin's 
work on Florentine architecture, from which I have copied 
the illustration, the Nicollini Palace does not seem to me to 
have the lightness and elegance of detail which Mr. Fer- 
gusson attributes to it ('History of Architecture/ v l- "* 



220 - HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

chap. 87). The appearance of lightness from the want 
of the rustication of the wall surface, which might be 
supposed to indicate a later date, is due rather to pail of the 
front being of brick, a common material in Italian Gothic. 
Making the whole of the rest of the surface of rough stones 
would have been incongruous, consequently the lower 
stories, which are of stone, have their stones hewn smooth 
on the surface ; but the appearance of strength is retained 
by rusticating the angles and arches. The arches and 
angles beside the brickwork are also hewn smooth, from 
the same desire of avoiding too great contrast, while the 
piers of the loggia above them are in single stones. The 
angle piers of the building thus gradually get smoother 
as they rise ; they are rusticated in the two lower stories, 
where the appearance of strength was desired, of hewn stone 
in the next, in the highest without any joint at all. The 
different surfaces of rough stone, hewn stone, and brick, are 
used together with great artistic skill ; the Gothic and Classic 
features are combined without any sense of incongruity ; and 
the result is a noble and artistic design in admirable harmony. 

Like other Italian palaces, the Florentine have a great 
open central court surrounded by open arcades, which gives 
access to the rooms on each story ; probably a tradition from 
the houses of Eome and Pompeii. In the architecture of 
these arcades we find no trace of Gothic. In some cases, 
because being usually the last part of the building to be 
finished, the Classic style may have corne in by the time they 
were built, but even if built at the same time as the fronts, 
it may have been the fashion to use for them, as for churches, 
the purer Classic style, which was admirably fitted for them. 

In the neighbouring city of Sienna, architecture, both 
in Mediaeval and Renaissance times, was under the same 
influences as at Florence. In emerging from Gothic, her 
early Renaissance took similar forms and passed through 
the same stages. The Gothic towers overhanging the 



THE RENAISSANCE IN T FLORENCE AND STENNA. 221 

market-places in both cities are the same in form an 
unadorned square shaft, with great straight corbels sup- 
porting little arches on which stand the battlements ; with 
a smaller similar tower inside. 

But the Sienna tower is of brick. Sienna had no quarries 
which could give her the magnificent stones of Florence. 
It is an unpractical criticism of Mr. Fergusson's (vol. iii. 
p. 89) that "the defect of the Sienna buildings is that the 
stones employed are too small to give effect to a design 
depending so much on rustication as the Tuscan palaces." 
There is no evidence that the Sienna architects aimed at the 
Florentine effect of rough wall. 

In the Spanocchi Palace, commenced by Griorgio in 1472, 
the arches throughout, as in the Florentine palaces, have 
the outline of the arch stones pointed, while the arch open- 
ings are semi-circular. These are filled with tracery con- 
sisting of two round arches with a circle over them. This 
palace is built of tufa, a volcanic stone, the heads which look 
out between the corbels of the cornice being in terra-cotta. 

The Piccolomirii Palace, built by the same architect about 
thirty years later, is of travertine. It has the same kind 
of tracery, but the pointed form of the outside rim of the 
arch has disappeared. Montigny and Farnin, the authors 
of the excellent series of measured drawings of Tuscan 
architecture (Paris 1866), to which I have already referred, 
give the following estimate of the artistic merit of this 
palace : " Dans son ensemble ce palais est d'un aspect 
grandiose et peat etre conside're' comme un des plus 
beaux de Toscane." This is different from Mr. Fergusson's 
estimate of the same palace quoted above. With such 
diversity of opinion among experts, what is the reader to 
believe ? Such excathedra judgments are of little use. Art 
criticism seems to me to be of value only when it enables us 
to understand the meaning of a work of art, and the result 
which has been obtained under the conditions.

CHAPTER IX. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN ROME, 



THERE was little building in Rome till the beginning of 
the sixteenth century. Rome has no buildings showing 
the transition from Gothic to Renaissance, for she had no 
Gothic style of her own with which a compromise could 
have been made, or which could have resisted the influence 
of the splendid ancient Roman buildings she possessed. 

The architects of her palaces were chiefly Florentines, 
called there by the sumptuous expenditure in building of her 
popes and nobles during the first half of the sixteenth 
century. It is not within my plan to give examples of 
palaces covering acres, of three great stories, each thirty 
feet high. The social state which rendered them possible 
has disappeared. I content myself with giving the eleva- 
tion of a somewhat ordinary house with shops in the Via de' 
Bianchi (fig. 69) said to have been designed by Sansovino, the 
architect of the Library of St. Mark at Venice (born 1479, 
died 1570). Mr. Fergusson might consider it bad art, because 
it attempts to make two stories appear as if they were one. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN ROME. 



223 



Ordinary houses must have bedrooms and five or six stories of 
different heights, and to group two stories of windows to- 
gether into one story by means of cornices, or by pilasters, or 
by putting them under the same arch, as in some old Gothic

examples, is a method by which architects in various ages and 
styles have given proportion to their buildings, thus 
raising them above the artistic level of cotton mills. It 
seems as legitimate as the grouping together of windows 






224

on the same story, a device which Mr. Fergusson frequently 
commends. In this example the grouping of the windows 
is simple and skilful. To remove the cornices which 
divide the floors, or to put a cornice to mark each floor, 
would take the dignity and meaning out of the elevation. 
This house shows the Italian style fully developed, and it 
is interesting as a prototype of the style which has be- 
come the commonplace of London builders. For its success 
it depends almost wholly on good proportion, which unfor- 
tunately the London builders have not always given us. 






VENETIAN" RENAISSANCE. 225 



CHAPTER X.- 



VENETIAN RENAISSANCE. 



VENICE had a flourishing style of Gothic of her 
own, which, of all forms of Gothic, supplies the 
examples hest suited for modern use. It does not affect 
;he gloomy grandeur of the Florentine palaces, or the 
small barred windows of French and English mediaeval 
castles, for she was secure from foreign attack behind her 
' streak of silver sea ; " while the strong hand of her 
ligarchy rendered fighting among the nobles, inside the 
;own, impossible. Her palaces therefore were never castles 
or fortresses, but from the earliest times, in their fronts to 
he canals, had more window than wall. Her sea-girt 
)osition, like that of England, gave her colonies, and 
ommerce, and wealth ; in which others besides the great 
lobles were sharers, which she spent largely in building. 
Hence we find interesting specimens of architecture in mode- 
'ately sized houses (fig. 70). Her Gothic style was not pro- 
&gt;erly Italian, for Yenice was not properly a part of Italy. 
3er people considered themselves Romans, and she con- 
inued the traditions of the Roman empire which had been

transferred to the East, which influenced the eastern co? 
of Italy long after it had lost the West. The shape of the 
Doge's cap, and the use on state occasions of umbrellas like 
Eastern potentates, are traces of this Eastern influence. He] 
Gothic has an Eastern character. Her treatment of tl

as a beautiful form 
than a necessity of construction ; it was ornamented byj

cutting it into mouldings marking the lines of construction, 
Venetian Gothic was living and vigorous, and held its 
own against the Classic influence till the beginning of the 
sixteenth century, when it was still strong enough to force 
a compromise. The characteristic form of old Roman anc

revived Classic architecture was adopted the round arch 
behind a screen of columns and lintel but the Gothic spirit 
asserted itself in filling these arches with tracery, in which 
Classic forms were used, similar to that which had been 
already adopted by Alberti in Florence, and Giorgio in 
Sienna (fig. 71, the Yandramini Palace). Though the com- 
promise was natural in Italy, as is shown by its adoption in 
Sienna and Florence, it was not adopted north of the Alps. 
It is suited only for a round arch, and the northern Gothic, 
in giving up the pointed arch for its windows, had adopted 
not the round arch, but the straight lintel. In Italy, with 
the growing taste there for correct Classic, this tracery was 
felt to be unsatisfactory, and was soon abandoned. That it 
is an expression of the Gothic spirit, is shown by the fact 
that Sir Gilbert Scott has filled with it the windows of 
Sir Christopher Wren's Church of St. Michael's, Cornhill, 
which he has Gothicised. I dislike this form of tracery, 
and have never seen any modern example of it which 
seemed bearable ; but I find some difficulty in giving my 
reasons for the feeling. It seems unmeaning, and without 
any beauty of line, such as genuine Gothic tracery has. 
Certainly it serves no practical need of modern architecture. 

But every one admits the Yandramini Palace to be charm- 
ing. The tracery looks well in it ; and for once Mr. 
Fergusson pardons the introduction of the Orders as orna- 
ment and does not suggest an improvement by the sub- 
stitution of panelling. The design is so admirably worked 
out, there is throughout such perfection of grace and 
jharmony, that it is impossible to find fault with it. It is 
an instance of the old truth, that the artist is greater than 
his materials, and can express himself in any forms, if they 
re natural to him and he is used to them ; while he will 
il if he tries to fight with arms "which he has not 
roved." 

By the middle of the sixteenth century, the architecture 



230 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



had come under the same Classic influence in Venice as 
in the rest of Italy; San Michaeli was building several 
palaces, and Sansovino had begun his celebrated Library of 
St. Mark's. The great Cornaro Palace on the Grand Canal 
(fig. 72), commenced by the latter in 1532, gives some idea 
of his style. The main idea of the design is the same 

as that in old 
Eoman archi- 
tecture, ranges 
of arches behind 
a screen of co- 
lumns and en- 
tablature, but it 
has a greater 
amount of open- 
ing than the 
Eoman, in pro- 
portion to the 
wall. There is 
a variety of 
treatment in the 
lower and in 
the uppermost 
stories, and the 
two main stories 
are ornamented 
by balustrades, 
a charming in- 
vention of the Italian Renaissance. These and later 
architects who adorned the city were foreigners ; but, 
whether they were inspired by the spirit of Venice or 
worked to please Venetian tastes, their buildings are 
characterised by an oriental magnificence unknown in other 
Italian cities. " The great defect." says Mr. Fergusson 
(vol. Hi, p. 95), "in Sansovino's design of the Library of 




Fig. 72. 



CORNARO PALACE, VENICE. 



I 



STAIRCASE OF DUCAL PALACE, VENICE.

VENETIAN RENAISSANCE. 233 

St. Mark, appears to be that the architectural ornament is 
not necessarily a part of the construction." " It is felt that 
it might be away, or another class of ornament used, and 
the building would not only stand, but might perhaps look 
as well, or better. More than this, there is a quantity of 
sculptured ornament, figures in the spandrils, boys and 
wreaths in the frieze, and foliage elsewhere, which not only 
is not construction, but does not even suggest it. If all this 
were omitted the building would be relieved from that con- 
fusion of parts which is one of its principal defects ; or, 
if enrichment were necessary, more conventional ornament 
would have attained the same end, and if it could have 
been made to suggest construction, so much the better." 

This is to suggest the substitution, for that which he 
criticises, of another wholly different design of Mr. Fer- 
gusson's own. Even if the Venetian architects could have 
followed Mr. Fergusson's instructions in designing their 
buildings, whatever the gain might have been, it would 
have lost us many charming bits of art, and interesting and 
characteristic varieties of style. It seems wiser to accept 
the productions of great artists as they left them, and to 
endeavour to understand their meaning. 

The view of the Staircase of the Ducal Palace (fig. 73) 
is a striking example of this richness of ornament of the 
Venetian Eenaissance. It is said to have been designed by 
Sansovino. Its peculiarities are more probably due to the 
skill and fancy of Venetian workmen. It reminds us rather 
of G-othic freedom and exuberance than of Classic purity, and 
though almost lost among the richness, we can trace the 
survival of Gothic forms in the central boss and ribs of the 
vaulting. It is an example of the same sumptuous taste 
and skill in carving which continued long afterwards to 
produce richly carved furniture and mirror frames in Venice 
and throughout Italy. 

But all such irregularities were soon brought under strict 



234 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



Classic rule. The old art might still have some scope in 
carved mirror frames and furniture, but, in building, the 
Orders were the only rule. The art of architecture often be- 
came a sort of puzzle of fitting together in the same building- 
orders of different dimensions, but, of course, of exactly the 
same proportions. Palladio, in the Church of San Giorgio 
Maggiore, hit on an expedient which was much admired, of 
diminishing the size of the great order of the nave by raising 




Fig. 74. 



PESARO PALACE, VENICE. 



it on pedestals, so as to lessen its disproportion to the lesser 
order of the aisles. The Orders sat upon Architecture like 
the old man of the mountain ; they had to be carried about 
into positions where they were altogether out of place, and 
Architecture revenged the intrusion by reducing them to 
mere ornaments, and asserted her freedom in the sumptuous 
grandeur of the style of the Jesuits. 

In the seventeenth century this spirit of rich magnificence 
showed itself in external architecture. The Pesaro Palace, 



VENETIAN RENAISSANCE. 235 

of which the accompanying woodcut (fig. 74) gives an in- 
adequate idea, designed by Longhena about 1650, is a mass 
of columns and sculpture, very rich and beautiful, and a fit 
outcome of the spirit which made Yenice for a century 
later the gayest and most brilliant capital of Europe and 
the resort of all pleasure seekers. 

In the Church of San Zenobio, built about 1680 (see 
woodcut in Mr. Fergusson's book), the facade is richly 
ornamented with statues, and the gables are curved and 
broken and tossed about with luxurious freedom. 

The Church of Santa Maria della Salute, with its great 
scrolls with statues on them leading up to the dome, may, 
as Mr. Buskin says, be bad architecture, but, with the 
Dogana with its great gilded ball as a foreground, if we 
may judge from the innumerable times it has been painted, 
it must seem to artists the most charming of architectural 
compositions. We cannot conceive of Yenice without it ; it 
seems to embody her colour and beauty. 

The west side of St. Mark's Place is now occupied by a 
palace, built for their emperor by the Austrians, in this 
century while they held Yenice. It is very correct in style ; 
all extravagances have been carefully avoided, but it is dull 
and worthless as art, not worth criticism, and an example 
of the result to which criticism and fixed rules of art 
naturally lead. 

The results worked out and embodied in the sixteenth 
century by the great Florentine architects in Roman 
palaces, by Palladio in Yicenza, and by Alessi in Genoa 
(1500-1570), have ever since remained the rule and 
standard for domestic architecture among ail civilised 
nations. All departures from these rules, however charming, 
have been counted heresies, which it was the duty of all 
who aimed at perfection in architecture to discourage and 
suppress. The result has been the same as with fixed 



236 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

standards in other spheres of human thought and invention. 
The changes and developments natural among different 
peoples, or through individual genius, have been re- 
strained, but only at the price of the loss of national 
freedom and life in domestic architecture. 

A copy is apt to fall short of the original model, and in 
copying Italian palaces the builders on the other side of the 
Alps worked under a special disadvantage. The grandeur 
of the Italian palaces depends, in large measure, on the 
great mass of wall in proportion to the window openings. 
Each story is often thirty feet high, and the windows reach 
only halfway to the ceiling, leaving above them a great 
mass of unbroken wall. In the bright climate, windows 
of this size, in proportion to the size of the room, gave 
sufficient light. These lofty stories were built partly, 
no doubt, to obtain an effect of grandeur, but also for a 
practical purpose. In Italy, where there is great heat 
during the day and miasma at night, windows and all 
openings are kept carefully closed, except in the cool of the 
evening or in the morning when they are opened to renew 
the air. It was therefore necessary that the rooms should 
be of sufficient capacity to enclose enough air for a day's 
consumption. In England we can have constant ventilation, 
consequently our rooms need not be so lofty ; and in our dark 
climate, windows reaching only halfway up the wall of the 
room would give an effect not of grandeur but of dismalness. 
We want all the light we can get, and from as high a point 
in the room as possible. 

The conditions of building in the two countries are wholly 
different; and in merely copying Italian architecture for 
English use, our builders have lost its proportion and gran- 
deur. In the different circumstances a different treatment 
was required. 

In giving some account of Renaissance architecture 



VENETIAN RENAISSANCE. 237 

north of the Alps, we shall find interest and benefit not 
so much in great palaces designed by learned architects 
in imitation of those of Italy, as in smaller houses, where 
the builders felt themselves at liberty to modify the style, 
according to convenience and the old traditions of the 
country.

CHAPTER XI. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN FRANCE. 



FRANCE was the first country across the Alps wh( 
architecture was influenced by the new revival. 
Even in the reign of Louis XII. (A.D. 1498-1515) there 
are indications of the change. Under his successor, Francis 
L, palaces and castles in the new style were built in every 
part of the country. The constant intercourse with Italy, 
the interest of the Court in art arid its patronage of Italian 
artists, who were then acknowledged masters in all the arts, 
enriched the country, in the first half of the sixteenth 
century, with examples of the new style, of a complete- 
ness and correctness which was not seen in England and 
Grermany till nearly a century later. There is some evi- 
dence which would almost make it appear as if the new 
style had grown up independently and simultaneously in 
France and Italy. There is said to be undoubted documen- 
tary evidence that the town hall of Orleans, in which there 
is a mingling of Classic features in a design otherwise 
Gothic, was built in the fifteenth century. 

But French Gothic was a living and vigorous style. It

239 




maintained a long struggle with its invader, and even 
when the new style was accepted without question, 
mediaeval features continued to characterise it and were 
never wholly abandoned. By this union of the two styles 
the genius of the French in art produced one of the most 
charming forms of the Renaissance architecture, thoroughly 
worked out and 
finished, and ad- 
mirably suited for 
modern domestic 
requirements. 

One of the most 
marked character- 
istics which the 
French Renaiss- 

,nce inherited from 

he Gothic archi- 
cture of the 
country, was the 
tall pyramidal sla- 
ted roofs, pecu- 
liar to it among 
the Renaissance 
styles of Europe. 
A few examples 
found in Ger- 
many, due in part 
to French influence, 
but the true char- Fis - u - 
acteristic of German Renaissance and of German Gothic 
houses is, that the front is a great broad gable with several 
stories of windows in it. 

These tall pyramidal slate roofs are found chiefly in 
chateaux and mansions in the country ; sometimes also in 
town houses. They are a legacy from the later Gothic

style of the country, which it retains to the present day. 
It will be remembered that in attempting to give a rationale 
of Gothic architecture, I showed that, while in England 
the pointed arch bad in later Gothic become flattened, and 
the roofs had been made flat in harmony with it, in France 
pointed vaulting and pointed windows having been retained, 
high steep roofs have been retained also. This habit 
no doubt, encouraged by the quarries of beautiful slates 
which almost every province of France possessed, durable 
and thin, capable of being cut into any forms or worked into 
any curves or angles and, when laid, forming a beautifully 
even surface. The excellence of the material led the 
builders to take a pride in their roofs and to make the most 
of them, and to prefer slate roofs to gables, sometimes even 
in their churches. In the treatment of the roofs lies the 
chief charm of the pretty little Gothic Chateau de Thery, 
which is here illustrated. It will be seen from this illus- 
tration that these sloping or " hipped " roofs, as they are 
technically called, are better suited than gables to the round 
and octagonal towers and to the machicolations the para- 
pets projected on corbels, which we see here, leaving 
openings for throwing stones and molten lead down on 
besiegers of mediaeval military architecture. In many 
French buildings (e.g. the new building of the Louvre) these 
pyramidal roofs are truncated so as to form a square plat- 
form on the top surrounded by an ornamental railing. 
Sometimes they terminated in a form like a chisel edge as 
in the entrance tower of Jacques Coeur's house at Bourges 
(fig. 44, p. 154). 

These tall roofs have lately become very fashionable in 
England, partly because they express the Gothic tendency to 
height, with which most of the architects are imbued ; no 
doubt also, because they give a good deal of show for the 
money. All about London now they break up the modest 
roof-lines of the older architecture. They are apt to look 



i 



THE RENAISSANCE IN FRANCE. 241 

pretentious here, as there is neither tradition nor convenience 
to justify them, for they make the neighbouring chimneys 
smoke, and when stuck on the top of houses already of 
seven stories, they compel their chimneys to be carried so 
high that they cannot be swept. They are dangerous 
for fire. Constructed of wood and rising high above the 
party-walls separating the houses, the flames spread with 
the wind from one high roof to another. These high roofs 
were, it is said, a chief cause of the destructiveness of the 
great fire at Chicago, where this fashion apparently had 
been adopted. On houses in the country they make hard 
shiny black spots in the landscape, for our slates are not so 
beautiful as the French. 

Another feature which French Eenaissance inherited 
m the G-othic style of the country is, that the windows 
ave mullions and transoms. From an early period French 
Grothic had given up the use of the pointed arch for domestic 
buildings. The little French chateau (fig. 75) illustrates 
this, as does also Jacques Coeur's house at Bourges (fig. 
44, p. 154), in which all the windows are square-headed, 
except that of the chapel over the entrance, which is filled 
with tracery and pointed, thereby fitting better the vault- 
ing of the chapel ; also perhaps, because traceried windows 
had come to be considered specially ecclesiastical features. 

Mullioned and transomed windows continued for some 
time a universal characteristic of French Eenaissance. 
They formed part of the original design of the Tuileries, 
and of the Louvre, as we know from contemporary drawings 
in Du Cerceau's book on Architecture. The stone mullions 
and transoms are now removed, but a similar effect is 
obtained in these and other French buildings by broad 
divisions of wood occupying the same positions. 

Another inheritance of French Renaissance from the 
VOL. i. R 




242 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

mediaeval style was a castellated or semi-fortified character. 
Since the invention of cannon the nobles found that their 
castles had become useless as fortifications. They were 
dark and inconvenient as dwellings, consisting of massive 
towers at the angles with solid curtain- walls between, 
enclosing the great tower or keep; the only openings, 
except in the highest stories, being small narrow slits, 
which a man could not get through. Inside, the staircases 
and passages were narrow and tortuous, so as to puzzle an 
enemy if he got in. 

With the new style came a new building impulse. King, 
nobles, and commoners re-housed themselves with larger 
accommodation, greater splendour, and above all, with 
abundance of window light. A desire for abundance of 
light in their dwellings characterised the style of this 
period in France as well as the contemporary Tudor style 
in England. It seems almost as if they expressed in their 
dwellings their delight in the light which they felt the new 
learning had brought them ; possibly it was only a reaction 
from the darkness which the necessities of defence had 
hitherto compelled them to endure. 

The castles being now useless as fortifications did not 
require a garrison. But in rebuilding them their accom- 
modation was not lessened. Larger and more splendid 
rooms than the old ones were wanted, and the nobles 
did not much diminish the number of their retainers. 
They were a sign of power and importance, and the men- 
at-arms continued in the house, rendering the old sort of 
menial service of various kinds, in addition to their mili- 
tary duties, which were now dispensed with. The tradition 
remains to the present day; footmen and men-servants 
being kept in great houses for show rather than for use. 

In most castles the solid curtain-walls between the angle- 
towers were pulled down, and on their sites ranges of well- 
lit buildings were built, giving greatly increased accornmoda- 






THE RENAISSANCE IN FRANCE. 



243 



tion. But the angle towers were left. They gave Rome 
accommodation, one dark vaulted room on each story ; 
while the curtain-walls gave none except by the sheds 
leant against them. It is a characteristic of almost every 
period of architecture but our own, that any work of pre- 
decessors which could be turned to use was never pulled 
down. Possibly also, the nobles kept the towers as the 
symbols of their former power. 

These towers, thus left in the chateaux when they were 
rebuilt and fitted for modern use, gave them the look of

fortified buildings, a character which was carried out in 
the parts which were rebuilt, and also in the new chateaux 
of the period. In both new and old, the moat or ditch of 
water round the castle was retained, though it had ceased 
to be useful for defence, from old habit or because it was 
a symbol of former power and importance. The possession 
of it was accounted a sign of signorial rights. 

This process of remodelling old fortified places is well 
illustrated *by the house of Jacques Coaur at Bourges (fig. 76).

He had bought for the site a portion of the old city walls 
which had become disused in consequence of the extension 
of the city. He pulled down the curtain-walls between the 
towers, and replaced them by ranges of elegant buildings. 
The towers he worked into the plan, remodelling them and 
making them fit for habitation by inserting larger windows. 
The greater thickness of the walls shown on the plan 
distinguishes the old from the new buildings. 

The narrow windows or loop-holes in such towers, 
lighting each story, were usually in a tier, one above the 
other. Though the openings were small on the outside, 
they widened out inside into large deep bays in the thick- 
ness of the walls. It was therefore easy to cut a wide gash 
from top to bottom in the tower in which larger windows 
were inserted. These were built in the new style, flanked 
by pilasters which covered the junction of the new and 
old masonry. As the opening had been made from bottom 
to top, these pilasters were carried continuously through the 
whole height of the tower one above the other ; there was 
no mass of plain wall dividing the rows of windows in the 
different stones as in Italian architecture. 

These tiers of windows dividing the wall perpendicularly 
through all the stories became a feature of the French 
Renaissance. By enforcing perpendicular lines, they ex- 
pressed the tendency to Grothic principles of design, which 
influenced the builders more than the principle of dwelling 
on the horizontal lines characteristic of Classic architecture. 
This arrangement was adopted in new buildings. 

The Chateau d'Azy-le-Rideau, in the department of Indre- 
et-Loire (fig. 77), is one among innumerable examples of this 
mode of treatment, though the amount of window obtained 
is less than usual. 

The spread of the new architecture in France was very 
rapid. There was a rage for building in the beginning of 
the sixteenth century. Architecture and the decorative arts

THE RENAISSANCE IN FRANCE. 247 

were matters of interest to king and people, as we see from 
the wealth and favour given to Italian artists. 

The palaces and chateaux then built are still the best in 
France. Only in towns decayed and deserted do we find 
houses older than this date, and however interesting 
archseologically these may be, they are poor dwelling-houses 
according to our notions. Chateaux and manor-houses were 
everywhere of a charming grace and kindliness of aspect, 
which does not suggest that oppression of the peasants for 
the next two hundred years, which in the Revolution sent 
so many of them up in flames. 

In the earlier buildings of the reign of Francis 1. Gothic 
details still prevail. In the Chateau of Nantouillet, built by 
his minister, Duprafr, in 1520, the front is divided by Classic 
pilasters and mouldings not attempting Classic proportion, 
while the jambs and mullions of the windows have Gothic 
mouldings and bases. The staircase has pointed windows 
with tracery supported on mullions, which are shaped like 
Classic balusters, and has vaulting of the most intricate 
design, following the slope of the steps, the vaulting ribs 
being curved in two planes. There are the usual indications 
of an effete style ; no crudeness, but an attempt to excite a 
sensation by intricate and wonderful workmanship. 

The new style soon worked off all traces of Gothic form, 
and frankly accepted the Classic orders and details, but it 
was no slave to them. The spirit of freedom in which the 
practice of Gothic had trained the builders prevented this. 
The French genius in art used the materials of Italian 
architecture with a freedom and power of invention which 
formed out of them an original style. They did not 
restrict themselves to the five orthodox orders, with their 
fixed proportions and stereotyped capitals, which indeed 
was an idea of later growth, hardly formulated at this time 
even in Italy. They invented new forms of capitals almost 






248

as various as Gothic ones, and altered the proportions of 
the coltimns and cornices to suit their buildings. To do 
this well, implied genius and originality in art. A claim 
for freedom and doing as we like in architecture is 

justifiable only when 
we have a power to 
originate beauty, and 
taste to restrain us in 
its exercise. Other- 
wise, it is better to be 
content to copy. 

French Renaissance 
long retained the 
Gothic feature of di- 
viding the windows 
by stone mullions and 
transoms, along with 
the Classic feature of 
pilasters flanking their 
sides. The house so 
called of Agnes Sorel, 
and the Episcopal 
Palace at Sens (of 
which drawings are 
numerous), 1 as also the 
little house at Orleans 
(fig. 78), illustrate this 
treatment. 

This house with 
its shop at Orleans 

which I have put into perspective from Sauvageot's 
drawing, is a fair specimen of the fully developed Re- 
naissance of Francis I. Gothic detail has disappeared; 
there is a reminiscence of it only in the form of the

THE RENAISSANCE IN FRANCE. 249 

windows with their mullions and transoms, and in the 
slender shafts supporting the arches of the door-ways, 
though the arch mouldings are Classic. But the spirit 
of the design is Gothic. It has the effect of decoration 
spread over the surface rather than the opposition of solid 
and void which is the principle of Classic. Instead of 
void being placed over void, and solid over solid, which 
is an essential rule of Classic, the two upper stories are 
differently centred from the lower, but this suggests no idea 
of weakness. As in Gothic architecture the upper stories 
spring from the lower one, rather than rest on it. The 
pilasters spring from corbels ; their weight is not carried 
down to the ground, as it would be in true Classic. The 
design is Gothic also in its irregularity and freedom, the 
windows are of any size, and placed not symmetrically, but 
in whatever position they are wanted. Symmetry is thought 
of, but it is not paramount. For the sake of it the large 
arch of the shop is drawn partly over the opening and 
partly over the solid wall at the corner, so as to bring it 
under the centre of the larger window, which is treated as 
one of the centres of the frontj with two pilasters on each 
side of it. In all this there is more of Gothic than of Classic 
motive ; a pleasing confusion it would be too much to call 
mystery which makes us feel there is more in the design 
than we see at first sight, and makes this building, though 
an unimportant one, a good example of the principle of the 
Renaissance the Gothic spirit revealing itself in Classic 
forms. 

The front of the Church of Saint-Etienne du Mont beside 
the Pantheon at Paris (fig. 23, p. 66) exhibits another and 
a later development of French Renaissance. I have already 
referred to it as a typical example of the union in Re- 
naissance architecture of the Gothic spirit with Classic details. 
The front seems to have been added to the already existing 
church which shows itself through the traceried windows. 






250 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

The church, said to have been begun in 1537, is in the 
interior one of the latest productions of Gothic. Though 
worked out with Classic mouldings and ornament, it 
illustrates Gothic lightness and aspiration better than 
many Gothic buildings. 

I have chosen this front for illustration, as exhibiting the 
characteristics of the later Renaissance. There is no attempt 
at restraint or refinement of line in the design, but there is 
an effect of sumptuous picturesqueness, with an air of gaiety 
and aspiration, which may well atone for the incongruities 
for which Mr. Fergusson condemns it. 

Some of the buildings at the commencement of the reign 
of Francis I. (A.D. 1513) are without trace of Classic ad- 
mixture. Before the end of his reign in 1547, palaces such 
as Fontainebleau and the chateau of Madrid in the Bois de 
Boulogne, now destroyed, had been built, and the Louvre 
had been commenced, without a trace of Gothic in the 
details. For other important buildings, although Italian 
artists were employed to give designs, the native artists 
and workmen seem to have taken a good deal of their 
own way in carrying them out ; while in less important 
buildings, of which they were the designers, they merely 
added to their old Gothic designs some touches of the new 
manner which they had learned from the Italian masters. 
They did this with such thorough knowledge of practical 
requirements and feeling for art as to create a new and 
beautiful variety of style, more interesting and more pro- 
fitable for study than the correct Classic. 

In the next century Roman infallibility in the province 
of architecture had crushed out national characteristics and 
individual freedom. But though this authority was formally 
acknowledged, it was not obeyed. Gallic liberties were 
asserted and maintained in architecture as in religion. 

It is not within the scope of this book to give a com- 



THE RENAISSANCE IN FRANCE. 251 

plete history of French Renaissance architecture, or to 
refer, except briefly, to the forms which it assumed in 
succeeding reigns. Any one interested in the subject 
will find information in the volume of Mr. Fergusson's 
book on the Renaissance styles, especially in the woodcuts 
with which it is illustrated. I cannot, however, always 
agree with Mr. Fergusson in his criticisms on these 
styles. 

The architecture of the time of Henry II. (1547-59) 
had the purer Classic forms of the later style of his father, 
covered with rich and beautiful ornament. A well-known 
example is the south buildings of the court of the Louvre, 
where Henry's initial is united on the carved panels with 
that of Diane de Poitiers. 

The style of Charles IX. (1560-74) had many of the 
characteristics of our own contemporary Elizabethan, an 
outcome of the same spirit which delighted in quirks and 
fancies, which took Classic features such as the projected 
corner stones and carved them with bands and straps, made 
columns and pilasters tapering outwards instead of inwards, 
and finished them with grotesques for capitals. The world 
was young again and was playing itself. 

But the authority of the Classic style was ever reasserting 
itself. The palace of the Tuileries, commenced by Catherine 
de Medici in 1564, from the designs of Phillibert de Lorme, 
is almost pure Classic, but French rather than Italian in 
character. 

In Henry lY.'s reign (1589-1610) architecture became 
still more Classic. In the two great pavilions which he 
added at each end of the fa9ade of the Louvre, he employed 
great pilasters running through two stories. In the designs 
of the gallery, which he commenced to connect the palace 
with the Louvre, this range of great pilasters is continued, 
surmounted by pediments alternately curved and straight- 
sided. The design is mere external ornament, the windows 






252 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



being placed alternately under the centre of these pediments, 
and in the spaces between them. 

The architecture of the palace of the Luxembourg, 
designed about 1611 by De Brosse, is better, inasmuch as 
it accords with the internal arrangements. The order 
ranges with each story. It is said that Catherine de' 
Medici, for whom it was built, insisted that it should he a 
copy of the Pitti Palace at Florence not evidently of its 
massive front of gigantic stones, but of the later buildings 
towards the Boboli gardens, which it resembles in the 
smaller and more orderly rustication with which its surface 
is covered.- A French character is given to the building 
by the tall slated roofs, which are unknown in Italy. 

During the long reign of Louis XIV. (1643-1715) the 
authority of the Classic orders was unquestioned, but an 
independent style grew up alongside of them, employed 
chiefly in internal decorations. We know it as the style of 
Louis Quatorze, and its influence on our upholstery has 
continued to our own time. Those strange twisted carvings 
like capital G-'s interlocked, which we find on chiffoniers at 
seaside lodgings, are the last dregs of it. Straight lines 
and rectangles are the natural forms for a panelled door. 
But in this style they were bent and curved and broke out 
in flourishes.* In one instance which I have seen, even the 
window-bars which divided the window into small panes 
were curved in wavy lines, so as to give the panes orna- 
mental forms, in sympathy with the decoration of the room. 
In French hands the style was graceful and elegant, but, 
like the morals of the court whose palaces it adorned, 
it was not pure. In religion, after due deference was paid 
to the authority of the Church, society felt unrestrained 
in luxury and morals ; and, in the architecture of the time, 
" the Orders" having been duly acknowledged, usually 
in some outside part where they did not interfere with 
convenience, unrestrained liberty prevailed in the internal 






THE RENAISSANCE IN FRANCE. 253 

decorations, which, however, were always charming and 
gay. One feature of these decorations is the prevalence of 
white. We wonder now at finding oak carvings painted 
white, and think it due to the barbarism of a subsequent 
time ; but in France, and in this country also, it was so in- 
tended from the first ; our laborious and expensive scraping 
to show the surface of the oak being often quite opposed to 
the intention of the original design. 

The exterior architecture is handsome and elegant, but 
dull. It is always on its good behaviour ; its first essential 
is symmetry ; carried out not only to the remotest corner of 
the building the kitchen wing on one side the exact copy 
of the stable wing on the other but to the bridges 'and 
summer-houses of the gardens, and miles away in the straight 
alleys through the woods. The orders are scrupulously 
correct. The decorations are -strictly confined to Classical 
subjects; nymphs, gods and goddesses; the representation 
of a Frenchman of the period being permissible only on 
condition of its being in Roman costume. 

This style continued during the earlier part of the reign 
of Louis XY. (1715-1774). A book of plans and designs 
for chateaux, * De la distribution des Maisons de plaisance 
et de la decoration des edifices en general," published by 
Jacques Fraiwjois Blondel (Paris, 1737-1738), an architect 
of this time, throws much light on the habits and ideas . of 
the aristocracy. One of the most striking features to us 
is the absence of servants' accommodation. Occasionally, 
in explaining a plan, the author states that servants' rooms 
are provided in the roofs ; but Classic authority had by 
this time succeeded in flattening the roofs to the low Italian 
pitch ; the rooms are miserable in size, and, with only slates 
between them and the air, hot in summer, cold in winter. 
No windows in the elevations give indication of their 
existence ; the dignity of the architecture was far too im- 



254 HOUSE AKCHITECTURE. 

portant a matter to be sacrificed for the sake of light and 
air for servants. 

The space is quite inadequate for the numberless servants 
of a great French house. Doubtless, however, many of 
them lived not in the house, but in the village beside it, 
the near neighbourhood of which the seigneur no more felt 
an intrusion on his privacy than we do the servants' ac- 
commodation of our houses, for it belonged to him, and only 
his dependants lived in it. This custom of the servants of 
a great house living not in it but in the neighbourhood still 
survives in the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge. 

The plans of these French chateaux indicate a life of which 
the aim was display and pleasure. On the ground-floor 
magnificent ranges of entertaining rooms ; on the upper 
floor, the central feature is the lord's bedroom with its ante- 
chamber for those who attended his " levee," and sometimes 
a low rail like that across a chancel, making a sacred en- 
closure round the bed, within which the specially favoured 
were admitted while he was dressing. There is always a 
"dfyagement" by which he could leave his room without 
encountering those waiting for him in the antechambers. 
The larger chateaux of this age had usually connected with 
them a building, called the Trianon after that at Versailles, 
the purpose of which was to allow a small select company 
to disembarrass themselves of the crowd of guests in the 
great house. It contained rooms for billiards and card 
playing, a small kitchen for private dinners, and a couple 
of bedrooms, one with a private cabinet for the lord. 
" All these little apartments," says Blondel, describing a 
" Trianon," of which he gives designs, " being for relaxa- 
tion, nothing should be neglected to render the decoration 
joyful and gallant. Here genius may take a spring and 
abandon itself to the vivacity of its caprices, not as in the 
apartments of parade, where she should restrain herself 
within the most exact rules of propriety and good taste, and 






THE RENAISSANCE IN FRANCE. 255 

not fall into the unmeasured liberties of our modern sculp- 
ture and ornament, which ought to be banished from these 
all the more that true architects can scarcely tolerate them 
in places such as I am describing." " In the card-room 
Indian and Chinese plants and figures may form part of the 
decoration ; they are naturally suited to it, and it is in this 
place only that in my view they should be admitted." 

Such determined efforts at pleasure produce a saddening 
effect, which somehow seems to communicate itself to the 
architecture, which is dull, in spite of its unmeasured licence. 

In the latter part of the reign of Louis XV. the style 
of architecture and decoration became simpler and more 
severe. The same influence showed itself at the time in 
England also, as in the refined and elegant forms of silver- 
plate in the reigns of the early Georges. The appreciation 
of Classic form became more accurate and the attempts to 
imitate it more successful, if less interesting, as in the 
Church of St. Genevieve at Paris, better known as the 
Pantheon ; the building of which occupied the latter part 
of the eighteenth century. 

The troubles of the Revolution and the uncertainty which 
preceded it were not favourable to architecture ; and, when 
the country again became settled under the empire, taste had 
become still more accurately Classic. The old Roman inven- 
tion of inserting an arch between the columns was perceived 
to be a mistake. In the Madeleine and the Bourse at Paris 
the columns stand free, supporting the entablature, and 
forming a colonnade round the walls of the building as in 
a Greek temple. 

The Gothic revival of our time has had little influence in 
France, compared with what it has had in England. A few 
churches have been built in the style which, though they 
Lave most of them the merit, which ours seldom have, of 



256 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

being vaulted, are generally poor and weak in design. 
Houses in the style are rare, and public buildings almost 
unknown. At the same time, France has produced excellent 
books on the old historical Gothic. 

During the reign of Louis-Philippe, and in the earlier 
days of the second empire, some houses were designed in 
what is called the Neogrec style. Some of these are 
interesting 'and beautiful; not slavish copies of Greek 
remains, but a new form of the style suited to modern 
wants and showing invention and originality. But this 
fashion, too, has passed, and the tendency now seems to be 
to return to the earlier developments of the Renaissance 
style of the country. Tall steep roofs had never been 
wholly abandoned. They are a characteristic of the modern 
street architecture. The galleries by which Napoleon III. 
united the Tuileries to the Louvre exhibit this feature, 
with a great dormer window on each side, exuberant in 
decoration. Some of the hotels lately built near the 
Champs-Elysees exhibit still earlier forms of French 
Renaissance, occasionally even windows with stone mull ions. 

French, architects generally show more knowledge and 
training in their work than ours, except when they attempt 
Gothic, in which their opportunities have been fewer and 
their skill is inferior. Their houses are more complete in 
style throughout than ours, for it is the custom there that 
the architect designs and superintends not only the building 
proper but the decorations and the furniture, which with us 
are often left to the upholsterer. The French workmen, too, 
are better-skilled than ours in art. Their Classic traditions 
have not been broken, and though they do not profess them- 
selves " art workmen," they inherit a style, and give their 
work an artistic character naturally and without effort, and 
therefore cheaply. 

It would be foolhardy to attempt to predict what will be 



THE RENAISSANCE IX FRANCE. 257 

the future style of domestic architecture in France; for 
there, as with us, the style is determined in each instance 
by the taste and skill of the individual architects. The 
new buildings of the Palace of Justice at Paris, designed 
by M. Le Due (not M. Viollet-le-Duc, the author of the 
excellent Dictionary of Gothic Architecture), exhibit an 
original treatment of Classic, refined and almost Greek 
in character. Other instances, especially some modern 
chateaux and hotels outvie the richest examples of the 
old Renaissance in exuberance of ornament and curved 
forms. There seems little prospect at present that a 
single style will prevail over the country at one time, 
gradually growing, or changing as new influences affect it, 
as was the case with the old historical styles. It seems more 
likely that we may see what has already happened in cos- 
tume and ladies' dress, which are governed no longer by 
tradition, but by passing fashions. But the fashions in 
architecture, however frequently changing, will probably 
keep within the limits of the Classic style, which has for 
three centuries been the style of the country.

CHAPTER XII. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN GERMANY AND THE LOW COUNTRI] 



THE new light of the Renaissance in art came to 
G-ermany later than to France. Its first glimmer- 
ings came through the painters, who crossed the Alps 
into the north of Italy to study the works of the 
great contemporary Italian school. The elder Holbein 
(b. 1498, d. 1559) was one of the earliest. Albert Diirer 
(b. 1471, d. 1528) was in Venice in the year 1506, but 
the Renaissance influence which these and others brought 
back extended no farther than their paintings, in which 
Classical backgrounds begin to appear. 

Many years elapsed before the new spirit began to affect 
architecture. It showed itself first about 1520, in ecclesi- 
astical palaces and bishops' monuments; for the bishops 
were naturally in constant communication with Italy and 
looked to it as a source of light in this as in other matters. 
The parts of Germany which remained Roman Catholic 
adopted the Renaissance architecture earlier than those 
which became Protestant. 

The old part of the palace at Dresden was built in 1530. 






RENAISSANCE IN GERMANY AND THE LOW COUNTRIES. 259 

By the middle of the century the new style had begun to 
spread rapidly. 

Like other Eenaissance styles the German inherited the 
features of the Gothic of the country. The special charac- 
teristic of German domestic Gothic was a tendency to give 
importance, by ornament and great size, to the gables. 
Sometimes they were covered with tracery worked on the 
surface in stone or in brick. The two gables from Nurem-

GABLES AT NUREMBERG. 



berg (figs. 79 and 80) show a pretty treatment in brick, by 
means of small projections or buttresses terminating in 
little Gothic arches. The chimney is placed not on the 
apex, but on the side, so as not to destroy the triangular 
form of the gable. 

But the most usual form was the stept gable. Instead of 
the gable following the line of the roof and sloping with it 
to the apex, it was carried up above it, and diminished by 
several great steps or intakes. These steps were ornamented 
with tracery, sometimes pierced where they projected above 
the roof to give them greater lightness and play of light. 

s 2 






260 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



These gables had usually several stories in their height. 
They were the features in the building of most interest to 
the designers ; the chief field for ornament ; in towns they 
were towards the street. These characteristics the German 
Renaissance inherited, changing the Gothic ornaments and 
details into Classic ones. 

This process is well illustrated by the accompanying 
drawing of part of a street in Minister (fig. 81), which has 
already been given, but is inserted here for convenience of 
reference. The taller house is a typical example of late 
Gothic, though it has lost something of its Gothic character, 
from the removal of the rnullions and tracery of the windows. 
The lower part is without ornament, but from the cornice 
level the design springs upwards with true Gothic aspira- 
tion. The stepping of the gables is disguised somewhat by 
the ornamental pillars or pinnacles, as compared with the 
simple steps of the gable of the house farther off, part of 
which the drawing shows. 

The Renaissance house is similar in design. The arcade 
of pointed arches probably belongs to an earlier building, of 
which this portion had been left when the house was rebuilt, 
as it is a portion of the continued arcade of the street. As 
in the Gothic house, the lower stories are plain, and the 
ornamentation commences at the cornice level. This 
gable also is stept, but the steps are disguised by being 
filled up with scrolls. The horizontal lines are more 
enforced ; the chief characteristic of Classic architecture, as 
compared with Gothic. There is not the same impression 
of aspiration, though Gothic influence survives in the little 
spikes or pinnacles, but there is more ease and gaiety. 

The general effect of this gabled architecture is shown by 
the accompanying drawing of one of the streets of Landshut 
(fig. 82). It contains both Classic and Gothic houses, but the 
effect of the two is so similar that we hardly distinguish them. 

T.his mode of building a street, by setting the gable ends 




*'ig. si. 



HOUSES AT MUNSTER, WESTPHALIA. 



RENAISSANCE IN GERMANY AND TEE LOW COUNTRIES. 265 

towards it, is unpractical and inconvenient. It necessitates 
a gutter between each house, which can have no overflow 
except at the ends, and, if it leaks, leaks into the houses. 
If the chimneys are in the party-walls, which is often the 
most convenient position for them, they must rise from this 
gutter to the height of the ridge, with a risk of smoking, 
and expensive to build. There is danger besides, of fire 
spreading from one roof to another, when there is no solid 
wall between the houses rising higher than the roof. For 
these reasons the practice has been gradually given up. 

In the drawing of the Carolinen-Strasse, at Nuremberg 
(frontispiece), it will be seen that though some of the houses 
have their gables to the streets, in most of them the cornice 
is to the street, and the gable between the houses. 

An effect of as great or even greater picturesqueness is 
obtained by this means. It gives the expanse of roof broken 
up by little windows, characteristic of the Nuremberg houses, 
as well as smaller gables or dormer windows, toward the 
street. These were indispensable to a G-erman house, for 
the stories in these great roofs were used as store-places, 
and for the periodical washings of the family. The great 
stores of linen which each house possessed made the dis- 
comfort of a family washing necessary only about every 
three months. The same custom still prevails in Germany 
and Holland ; the extensive floor space of the stories of the 
roof was used for washing, mangling, and drying ; and to 
facilitate the last process, the little windows in the roofs 
were opened so as to create a through draft. Hence a 
derrick projecting over the street was necessary in each 
house, as may be seen in the drawing, for hoisting up or 
down the linen as well as the stores. Some part of the 
space was usually devoted to keep these. Other portions 
were occasionally used for drying apples, the produce of the 
family orchards. 

Nuremberg, above all other cities, gives one the impression 



266 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



of a city of the Middle Ages ; yet this impression is pro- 
duced by houses Classic in date and details. A Gothic city 
existed before the present one, as the two great Gothic 
churches testify, and the view in the Nuremberg Chronicle, 
in the year 1498. The Nassauer House (fig. 50, p. 177), and 
some others remain. But most of the streets have been rebuilt 
in Classic style, and so handsomely and conveniently that 
nothing would be gained by rebuilding it in the present day. 
Here, as elsewhere in the early Renaissance, the essential 
spirit of the style is Gothic. It has Gothic freedom and pictur- 

esqueness and aspiration, 
though doubtless the good 
burghers thought they were 
carrying out true Classic. 
The words were Classic, but 
they were embodied in the 
old language. The builders 
were trained to familiarity 
with them, arid used them 
as their natural mode of 
expression, but they had 
not changed their nature ; 
the Classic words express 
Gothic feelings and ideas. 
It is this unconsciousness, this perfect naturalness, which 
gives the charm to these streets. They are the natural out- 
come of the circumstances, and are entitled to be considered 
examples of a true style. (Frontispiece.) 

There is a character and picturesqueness about the Nurem- 
berg houses which gives a charm even to those in the poorer 
districts, like those in my sketch beside the river, fig. 83. 

In her Renaissance style Germany retained another 
characteristic of her Gothic architecture, the projecting bow 
windows, not rising from the ground, but hung out from 




Fig. 83. HOUSES ON THE PEGNITZ, 
NUREMBERG. 



RENAISSANCE IN GERMANY AND THE LOW COUNTRIES. 267 

the upper stories; which, as the illustrations show, occur 
so frequently in the houses. Almost every house in Nurem- 
berg has one such, usually attached to the principal dwelling- 
room of the house. That at St. Sebald's Parsonage, opposite 
the church, is a beautiful Gothic example, well known from 
photographs and drawings. There is a pretty little one on 
the centre of the Nassauer House (fig. 50, page 177), facing 
St. Lawrence Church. In the 
Renaissance houses of Nurem- 
berg they were usually square 
in plan, with a curved Classic 
pediment over them. This 
sketch from Freiburg in Breis- 
gau (fig. 84), is a late Gothic 
example of a square projecting 
oriel. Sometimes they were 
continued through the several 
stories, as in the house to the 
right in the drawing of the 
Carolinen - Strasse, (Frontis- 
piece, and the house at Wurz- 
burg, illustrated in page 273). 
But the form of projecting 
windows, peculiarly charac- 
teristic of German house 
architecture, is the Erker or ^ * ORIEL AT FREIBURG IN BREISGAU. 

Ecbfenster, a lantern or turret, pierced with windows all 
round, projecting from the corner of the house. The idea 
doubtless sprang from the angle turrets of Gothic fortifica- 
tion, of which the little house at Boppart (fig. 49, p. 176), is 
an illustration. The idea is fully developed in the beautiful 
example of late Gothic date at Augsburg (fig. 48, page 169). 
On the corner of the Bishop's house at Wurzburg (fig. 86) 
there is a beautiful and picturesque example, dating from 
the last quarter of the sixteenth century. It has carved on 







268 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



it the arms of Bishop of Julius who founded the university 
about 1590. It is Classic in the detail of the cornices, but 
Gothic in its picturesqueness as well as in the mullions and 
transoms dividing the windows. The other windows of 
the house have Gothic interpenetrating mouldings, even 
that over the pretty little Classic doorway with its fluted 
Corinthian columns. The Classic architecture seems to 
have been employed on the parts intended to be specially 
beautiful and ornamental. Where use alone was aimed at, 
the familiar Gothic was thought good enough. The mas- 
sive arched doorway, on the flank of the Bishop's house, 

seems an alteration of the 
eighteenth century. 

The drawing of the house 
opposite the Cathedral at 
Augsburg (fig. 9, page 40), 
gives a later example of 
these corner turret win- 
dows. The ogee form of 
the corbels supporting the 
turrets, as well as the 
flattened arches, seem to 
indicate that the building 
dates from the eighteenth 
century. Sometimes the builders made projections at the 
ground-level, as the little inn at Kriegshaben near Augsburg 
(fig. 85) shows. In date and details it is late Classic, but 
there is a picturesqueness, I must even say dodginess, in 
the arrangement of the structure which ought to charm the 
heart of a modern Gothic architect, and to convince him 
that the characteristics, which he loves so much, are not 
peculiar to his favourite style. 

These projections from the general wall surface of the 
houses give great interest and picturesqueness to the streets 
of Nuremberg and other German towns. They relieve the

dull monotony, which is the chief characteristic of our 
modern towns, and they make the houses pleasanter to live 
in. Our modern building Acts forbid them, partly with a 
view to uniformity and regularity, which it seems their 
great object to encourage, partly because the encroachment 
they make on the street is supposed to be an evil, and partly 
perhaps because the framers of these Acts seem to have 
thought that the small amount of skill in building required 
for their construction was -beyond what modern builders 
could with safety be allowed to attempt ; for they are for- 
bidden by the London building Acts, even where the house 
is set back from the street and they do not project over the 
roadway. 

Another characteristic of the Renaissance architecture of 
Germany, which is also found in her Gothic, is the arrange- 
ment of the ground-floor in the houses, and the uses to 
which it was put. It was not generally used for living 
rooms or bed-rooms. As in Italy, people seem to have 
preferred to live not on the ground, but one story at least 
above it. So the ground-floor was left to be utilised as 
best it might. Sometimes it was occupied as cellars, or 
for storing farm produce. When, as is still frequently the 
case in German towns, the merchant's house was also his 
place of business, the ground-floor served as the magazine 
for storing and selling his goods. Sometimes it was un- 
appropriated, left open to the street as in the Neu-Miinsterhof 
at Wurzburg (fig. 87), and provided with stone benches 
for public convenience ; or the front part of it, as at Miinster 
(fig. 81, page 261), appropriated as a covered arcade for 
foot passengers. 

The picturesque house in the same city (fig. 88, page 273) 
shows a characteristic feature of south German house 
arrangement in the great door, wide and high enough 
to admit a loaded waggon to the court behind, with the 
smaller door beside it for access to the house. Sometimes

almost the whole of this ground-floor was occupied witn 
large hall provided with stone benches, generally open to 
the public, from the inner end of which ascended the great 
staircase to the house proper, which occupied the floor above.

A special characteristic of German house architecture, is 
the imperfect development, and small importance of the 
chimneys, as compared with those in French and English 



REXAISSANCE IN' GERMANY AND THE LOW COUNTRIES. 273 

houses. This arose from the use of close stoves instead of 
the great open fireplace, common in France and with us. 
This feature also is an inheritance from Gothic times, for 
stoves of Gothic date still exist in Germany. There is one 
such in the Castle 
of Land shut, 
another in the 
Castle of Coburg, 
in a d e of c a s t- 
iron, and a very 
splendid one in 
the Rathhaus nt 
Oc h se M fur t h 
formed of mould- 
ed tiles coloured 
and glazed. 

Another feature 
of German house 
architecture is 
the frequency, 
especially in the 
northern pro- 
vinces, of houses 
wholly co n- 
structed of wood. 
The house at 
Hildesheim, of 
which I give an 
illustration, for 
which I am in- 
debted to the 
kindness of the F&gt;9 ' 
proprietors of The Builder,' is a notable example (fig. 90). 
It has, I believe, been destroyed by fire, but others similar 
still exist in that city and in other towns in the neighbour-

hood. It was constructed entirely of chestnut not like the 
usual post-and-pan houses of other parts of Germany, England, 
and northern France, of a wooden framework filled in with 
plaster panels It dates probably from about the year 1620, 
and is similar in its construction and in the ornament of 
its carved panels to some houses in the Rue de la Grande 
Horloge at Rouen. But in the tendency the design shows 
to dwell on the gables and make the most of them, and in 

the imperfect development of its 
chimneys it is thoroughly Ger- 
man ; the great gable is peculiarly 
German in character. Except as an 
ornamental feature, the second small 
gable round the corner has no 
raison cVetre. 

This house exhibits another 
feature, which so far as I am aware 
is not found in houses of the period 
in any other district. The upper 
windows, as will be observed, have 
sliding sashes. These unmullioned 
windows are so completely part of 
the design that it is improbable 
that they are an alteration of later 
date, especially as sash windows are 
found in other houses of the date 
in the same district. Sliding sash 
windows, which have now become a British institution and 
an important element of English comfort, came to us, like 
our broad dining tables, with Dutch William from Holland. 
But they seem to have been in use in north Germany before 
the Dutch adopted them. 

A feature of German architecture which strikes an 
Englishman at first as strange, are the bulbous protu- 
berances formed of copper which occasionally occur on the 




Fit-. 89. KATHHAUS, MANNHEIM. 







WOODEN HOUSE AT HILDESHEIM. 



RENAISSANCE IN GERMANY AND THE LOW COUNTRIES. 277 

roofs. The tower of the Rathhaus at Mannheim (fig. 89) 
terminates in one of these ; the lower part of this roof, where 
the square gathers into the octagon, is of slate. The tower 
itself is late Classic, not unpicturesque. Much more marked 
examples are to be found ; small spires blossoming into a 
string of them, like tulip bulbs stuck at intervals on a stick. 
They are not a peculiarly German feature : we all know 
the remarkable specimens on the Cathedral of Antwerp. 
They may not be correct architecture, probably they are 
not ; but they are quaint and interesting and picturesque, 
and the green colour of the copper is always beautiful. 

It has been impossible within my limits, to trace the 
successive developments of the Renaissance style in each 
province of Germany. Those who wish to gain this know- 
ledge will find the information, if they can read German, 
in Wilhelm Liibke's excellent work, * DieNeuere Baukunstin 
Deutschland,' published at Stuttgart in 1873, collected with 
true German thoroughness, and amply illustrated by excellent 
woodcuts. My aim has been merely to give some notion of 
the Renaissance style in Germany, and to show that here, 
as elsewhere, its peculiar development was influenced and 
determined by the native Gothic style of the country. 

The Renaissance architecture of Germany has not usually 
been considered to have great artistic merit, or much 
interest. Mr. Fergusson says of it (vol. iii. p. 336) : "The 
Germans were not more successful in their attempts at 
Secular architecture during the period of the Renaissance, 
than in their Ecclesiastical buildings. The architect wanders 
in vain through the capitals of Germany in hopes of finding- 
something either so original or so grand that it should dwell 
on the memory, even if it does not satisfy the rules of taste." 
" Nothing (p. 341) can be more unsatisfactory or less interest- 
ing than the history of German architecture during the 
Renaissance period." 



278 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

This is partly true if domestic architecture has no interest 
except in palaces where vast sums are expended. I think, 
however, that architecture may be interesting and worthy 
of study even in small houses for middle class people. The 
German nobles were not generally fortunate in their palace 
building. In the seventeenth century in their palaces, as 
in their government and their manners, they attempted 
clumsy imitations of the glory and elegance of the Court 
of Versailles, alien from the best characteristics of the 
people. But Mr. Fergusson's assertion (p. 341) that, 
"during the three centuries of the Renaissance period, the 
German nobles built no city palaces to be compared in any 
way with those which adorn every town in Italy, nor one 
single country residence that can match in grandeur the 
country seats that are found in every county in England," 
can be refuted by a number of examples. Llibke's book 
gives numerous examples of nobles' castles, and especially 
of town houses, which in their own way may fairly compare 
with those of other countries. 

But the German race has never been remarkable for the 
display of the highest qualities of art, either in colour or in 
form. Even her greatest painters cannot properly be called 
colourists, like the great Italians. Nor is their work re- 
markable for beauty of form ; their merit lay rather in 
depth of feeling and an elevated tone of truth and morality. 
The Renaissance architecture, which the Germans got from 
Italy, lost in their hands its beauty of line and perfection of 
proportion ; nor did it, as in France, acquire a special grace 
and refinement of its own. It has a want of elegance, 
sometimes even an air of clumsiness. But it has a pictur- 
esqueness and variety, which make German towns more 
interesting than any others in Europe, and truth and 
common sense, which is always satisfactory. 

These old German streets are certainly more interesting 
and beautiful than those which we are producing in our 



RENAISSANCE IN GERMANY AND THE LOW COUNTRIES. 279 

modern towns, arid yet they contain no marvels of art, such 
as we should be incapable of producing. I have attempted 
in a former chapter to give some of the reasons why we do 
not produce such streets. 

I have no intention of attempting to give an account 
and history of the Renaissance style in other countries of 
Europe, though in some of these, especially Belgium and the 
Low Countries, more artistic specimens of architecture are to 
be found than in Germany. Holland, though she produced 
a notable school of painters, seems to have expended little 
invention on domestic architecture. The houses are all 
of brick. The earlier ones have mullioned windows and 
simple step t gables; a type which prevails generally in the 
Low Countries. The later houses in Holland, as at Amster- 
dam, are all of one type, not unlike the older London red- 
brick houses, the idea of which seems to have been derived 
from them ; but the variations in the Dutch houses though 
very slight, the life which the water and boats of the canals 
and the trees which line their sides give them, make the 
canals of Amsterdam much more interesting than London 
streets. The style of the interiors is a mild echo of that of 
Louis Quinze. They are roomy and the workmanship is 
excellent. In one I visited, the owner told me that the 
white paint of the drawing-room had not been renewed 
for a hundred years. 

Belgium, perhaps in consequence of the Celtic blood 
of the people, had more art ; this was evident in Gothic 
times, and still more during the Renaissance. The deco- 
rations, especially of the houses and churches, such as the 
hammered brass-work, or Dinanderie, so called from the 
town of Dinan, where it was largely made ; the stamped 
leather for covering walls, and the ornamental sculpture 
in marble, rival those of Italy, whose type they followed. 






280 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



Italian influence was strong and direct. It is difficult of 
some ornamental work to say, at first sight, whether it is 
Italian or from the Low Countries. But native genius also 
gives itself free scope. In the carved wood pulpits of the 
great churches it revelled in a freedom which sometimes 
exceeded the bounds of taste and the capacity of the 
material. 

In Renaissance architecture the Low Countries produced 
a variety of their own, more refined and imaginative than 
the German. The town hall of Antwerp, erected by Cor- 
nelius de Yriendt in 1581, is a charming building; the 
open loggia under the roof gives interest and grandeur by 
its shadow, and reminds one of the similar feature in 
Florentine palaces. 

To this building the town hall of Amsterdam is a melan- 
choly contrast. No expense is spared ; it is of gigantic size, 
and built of stone in a country where every stone had to be 
brought from a long distance ; but the art to direct the ex- 
penditure was wanting. It is dull, heavy, and uninteresting. 
No fancy is displayed, and the proportions are bad. Am- 
sterdam was rich, but not artistic; she did not care for art, 
and did not know it when she saw it. She spent the money 
for brag, not for art, and got what she wanted. In this, she 
much resembles ourselves. We are anxious to be artistic, 
because it is the proper thing, and are, therefore, quite willing 
to spend money on it, but we do not quite know how. 

In Belgium the influence of its Spanish rulers gave 
greater surnptousness and magnificence to architecture and 
the decorative arts ; for the Spaniards, in those days, had 
amongst them artists as great as any in Europe, and they 
had lordly tastes. Under Spanish influence and to the 
order of Spaniards the most splended stampt-leather, the 
richest metal work, the most magnificent stained glass were 
executed. 

The group of houses in the Market Place, Brussels (fig. 91), 




HOUSES IN THE MARKET I'LACE, BRUSSELS.

shows this Spanish influence. They exhibit, in a degree 
rarely attained, the qualities of richness and sumptuousness. 
There is a playfulness about them which is very charming. 
Every house has a character of its own. That built by 
some admiral, with its gable like the stern of his ship, 
is specially picturesque and interesting. 

Great artistic skill is needed, when houses are mere tall 
narrow strips like these, to give them any artistic effect. We 
give up the attempt and make our houses by the foot 
run, and cut them off in lengths as required. 

It was not always so with us, as we shall see in the next 
chapter.

CHAPTER XIII. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 



THE new architecture, in anything approaching the 
purity of the Italian style, took root in England as 
the accepted style for ordinary buildings later than in any 
of the countries I have already spoken of. 

The English are a conservative people. The native 
style was strong and vigorous, sensible and suited to do- 
mestic wants, understood by the builders and liked by the 
people. They were proud of its achievements in buildings 
like King's College Chapel at Cambridge, and of the new 
magnificence which it had added to almost every church in 
the country, and they had no thought of such revolutionary 
change in their habits as the adoption of the new style would 
have involved. Till our own day, when the Grreat Exhi- 
bition of 1851 destroyed the last remnants of traditional 
art remaining in England, it survived still in some remote 
parts as the style of village tradesmen, for unimportant 
buildings such as cottages or barns. 

Yet there exist still in England pure examples of Classic 
art, dating from an earlier period than any such in Germany 



THE KEXAISSANCE IN T ENGLAND. 287 

or even in France. The tomb of Henry VII. in his chapel 
at Westminster, dating from the first years of his successor's 
reign which hegan in 1509, is the work of the Italian Tor- 
rigiano, and hears no trace of English Gothic influence. In 
the Rolls Chapel, Chancery Lane, there is a monument hy 
the same artist to Dr. John Young, Master of the Rolls, 
who preceded Sir Thomas More in that office. 

The ornamental parts of the stained-glass windows of 
King's College Chapel at Cambridge, are Classic in design, 
but these also are foreign importations, and had no influence 
on the general architecture. The fittings of the chapel, the 
altar-screen and stalls are also Classic ; but the old tradition 
of English art was too strong for such small and isolated 
examples to make any impression on it. They remained 
mere foreign importations. By the quarrel between the 
King and the Pope in 1533, when Cranmer pronounced 
the divorce of the marriage between Henry and Catherine, 
Italian ideas in this as in other spheres were deprived in 
England, as in the Protestant parts of Germany, of the 
influence they would otherwise have had. 

The Classic style was first introduced into the architec- 
tural construction of buildings, apart from mere decorative 
adjuncts, in Elizabeth's reign (1558-1603), in Longleat in 
Wiltshire; it is said, by John of Padua, between 1567 and 
1597. 

The accompanying view of this house (fig. 93) I copied 
from an old print, for the purpose of showing the arrange- 
ment of the gardens, which are now destroyed. It does 
not accurately represent the present condition of the house. 
The square projecting bays are in reality wider and flatter 
than shown ; their cornices are of pure Classic contour, 
without the corbels shown in the drawing, and the pilasters 
are broader and shorter in proportion. The aprons under 
the windows are different in form. The great door as it 
exists now is more purely Classic in character. It has only 






288 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

one column on each side, a broken Italian pediment the full 
width of the door, with a shield in the centre ; but this 
looks like a later alteration made when the terrace leading 
to it was destroyed to give space for a carriage-drive to the 
door, and the present great flight of steps made leading 
directly to it. In its essential features the building is late 
English Gothic, ornamented with a few Classic details, and 
so little impression had these made, and so thoroughly did 
the art of the country remain Gothic in principle that 
this drawing of a much later date Gothicises even its Classic 
features. 

To the influence of an Italian designer we probably owe 
the pilasters of the bays, with their entablature and cornice, 
which are designed in the actual building in excellent Classic 
proportions. In the spaces left between these are inserted, 
instead of the round arch of Classic architecture, English 
mullioned and transomed windows, obviously not due to the 
suggestion of an Italian artist, but to the English master 
mason of the period. This seems a scarcely adequate result 
for the employment of an artist specially brought from 
Italy. But in England as in France the Italian artists 
found a sphere for their art in the fittings and sculpture of 
the internal decorations. The external building was wisely 
left to the skill of the native workmen, who knew how to 
build to suit English habits and the English climate. 

In the time of King James the authority of the Classic 
orders had become an accepted article of faith, and a part of 
the ordinary building style of the country. This was due 
in some degree to the influence of the new literature. The 
Classic orders were part of the new light which the Re- 
naissance brought to mankind. The treatise of Vitruvius 
became the Bible of architecture. In it, and other books, 
and in buildings abroad, the new art was studied by many 
gentlemen, who doubtless tried, as country gentlemen some- 



THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 289 

times try now, to get their workmen to carry out their 
ideas. A great building like Longleat would train many 
workmen, who, regarding what they had there learned as 
the newest light on art, would, repeat it on the first oppor- 
tunity. These new ideas were adopted, as new or foreign 
words are taken into a language, of which the construction 
remains unchanged. So the principles and construction of 
the style remained English. The workmen accepted the 
Classic features of columns, entablature, and mouldings, but 
they did not catch the Classic spirit or ideas. 

The process of development was irregular, being de- 
pendent on the knowledge of the new architecture which 
each designer happened to have attained, so that the greater 
or less purity of the Classic details in a building is no sure 
test of its date. The result in the Elizabethan and Jacobean 
styles is very different from pure Classic, and was shocking 
to those who regarded the five orders as the standard of 
truth. When Classic architecture became generally known 
and acknowledged in authority, the new style was ridiculed 
as King James' Gothic. But it was the natural development 
of the circumstances, and is fairly entitled to be called a 
national style. 

It was full of the quirks and fancies, which, as the 
iterature of the time shows, occupied the minds of people 
n that generation. It delighted in abundance of window 
ight, as a reaction against the small narrow windows, 
itherto rendered necessary by the conditions of defence, 
3 if the builders wished to reproduce in their dwellings 
be new intellectual light. 

The drawings (figs. 94 and 95), for which I am indebted 
i the kindness of the proprietors of ' The Graphic,' of an 
iterior in Lime Street, pulled down by the Fishmongers' 
Company in 1876, show a fair example of the new style 
vhich was formed by the union of the Classic ideas with the 
Id native architecture. The screen between the two rooms 
VOL. i. u

(fig. 04) is according to the common Classic recipe the 
round arch inserted between the columns and lintel, 1 hut 
the workman has carved it out in his own way and has 
put his own ideas into it, as in the consoles of the frieze, 
which are after no Classic model, but of English growth. 
But there is no Classic authority for the design of the great 
chimney-piece (fig. 95). Classic columns and mouldings 
are used, but instead of the Classic principle of column 
resting upon column, massive below and getting lighter as 
it rises, the design springs upwards in great corbels, and 
the two columns in the upper part are supported, and 
supported without any sense of weakness, by the single one 
below. This lower column is of a form for which there is no 
Classic authority. Instead of its weight pressing down on 
the ground it seems to spring from it. The form is similar 
to that of a baluster. It occurs in French architecture, but 
it is a special note of the Elizabethan and Jacobean styles. 

Classic architecture in anything like purity of style was 
first introduced into England by Inigo Jones. An excellent 
life of him, which by careful research brings out many new 
facts, was published in 1848 by the Shakespeare Society, 
written by their Secretary, Mr. Peter Cunningham. From 
this I shall state briefly the main facts of his career as an 
architect. He was born in 1573, the son of Inigo Jones, 
Clothworker, living in the parish of St. Bartholomew-the- 
less, in West Smithfield, London. His father (a native, it 
is thought, of Wales) was badly off when Jones was a lad of 
sixteen, as there is record that he had difficulty in paying a 
debt of 80. He died in 1597, when Inigo was in his 
twenty-fourth year, leaving debts, but apparently little pro- 
perty. Inigo, it is said, had been bound apprentice to a 
joiner Ben Jonson ridiculed him as a joiner in any case 

1 The two arches in the screen were not of the same date, the one nearer the 
chimney-piece was a later addition, probably about Queen Anne's time. Its detail 
was more Classical than the earlier arch.

THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 295 

no bad training for an architect. He was early distin- 
guished, his pupil Webb tells us, for his skill in drawing 
and designing and in landscape painting. He went to Italy 
w hile young, but at what time is uncertain. " Being natu- 
rally inclined," he says in his book on Stonehenge, " in my 
younger years to study the arts of design, I passed into foreign 
parts to converse with the great masters thereof in Italy, 
where I applied myself to search out the ruins of those 
ancient buildings which, in despite of time itself and violence 
of barbarians, are yet remaining. Having satisfied myself 
in these, and returning to my native country, I applied my 
mind more particularly to architecture." Christianus IV., 
King of Denmark, Webb tells us, sent for him out of Italy, 
where, especially at Venice, he had resided many years. 
His stay in Denmark, Webb says, was long. In 1604-5. 
when in his thirty-second year, he had returned to England, 
where he was employed by the Queen of James [., Anne of 
Denmark, the sister of Christianus, along with Ben Jonson, 
to produce a Masque at the Court at Whitehall. 

During the succeeding years there are records of his 
being occasionally similarly employed, his share in the work 
being to design the scenery and dresses. Drawings still 
exist of the figures and characters which he prepared for 
these occasions. 

In 16 10, Prince Henry appointed him Surveyor of Works 
in his newly established household, in which year he em- 
ployed him in devising the scenery of a masque. He held 
this office till the Prince's death in 1612, when he went again 
into Italy, as we know from an entry in his copy of 
'Palladio,' dated "Vicenza, Mundaie the 23rd of September, 
1613." Entries in his sketch-books show that he was at 
Rome, Naples, and Vicenza in 1614. In 1615 he returned 
to England to take possession of the office of Surveyor of 
the Works, the reversion of which the King had promised 
him. The office gave him sufficient employment in superin- 



296 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

tending the repairs of the King's numerous manor-houses 
and palaces, in arranging for royal progresses, and occasion- 
ally in devising scenes and machinery for masques and en- 
tertainments at Court, which were the occasion of a deadly 
quarrel between him and Ben Jonson. 

In January 1629, the old Banqueting-house at Whitehall 
was burnt down, and Jones was commissioned to build a 
new one, the first stone of which was laid in June of the 
same year, and the building finished in March 1622. By 
an account preserved in the Audit Office, it appears that the 
basement was of Oxfordshire stone, cut into rustick on the 
outside ; the upper part of Northamptonshire stone, and the 
balusters of Portland. As the whole of the present building is 
of Portland stone, it must have been refhced at a later period. 

In 1620 he received the King's commands to investigate 
Stonehenge. From " some few undigested notes," which 
he had left, Webb published a treatise which declared that 
Stonehenge was a temple of the Tuscan order, raised by 
the Romans, and consecrated to the god Coalus, the origin 
of all things ; an idea possibly suggested to suit the views of 
" the wisest fool in Europe." 

In 1618 he commenced the chapel at Lincoln's Inn, which 
was consecrated in 1623. The cloisters under it were in- 
tended as a place for the lawyers to meet their clients. This 
work is specially interesting, as showing the hold the 
old style still had, and the architect's knowledge of it. 
Notwithstanding its Doric columns and pilasters, from 
which the Gothic arches spring, it is able work. There was 
a rumour, I hope unfounded, that the Benchers actually 
proposed to destroy this piece of history, by "restoring" 
the chapel into correct Gothic. 

About this time Jones 1 built the beautiful water-gate 

1 This has been doubted. There is a record that it was built by Stone, a builder 
at the time, but Jones may have given the designs. It looks like his work, and in 
style resembles the gate at the Botanical Gardens at Oxford, which he designed. 









THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 299 

to the town house of Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, still 
standing at the foot of Buckingham Street (fig. 96). The 
view shows it from the land side. A flight of steps under 
the centre arch descended to the water. On the river side 
the base has been buried under the new embankment. 
Perhaps some day the earth which conceals it might be 
removed, and a pond made before it, which, now that 
the river which once washed it is far removed, would 
suggest its original purpose. It is one of the few build- 
ings which remains as it came from his hand; untouched 
save by time, which has given it colour and interest, and, if 
it has worn and softened the mouldings, still lets us trace 
his actual work. May it be spared from the restorer's or 
the destroyer's hand ! 1 

His next important works were the great west portico 
of old St. Paul's, and the Queen's house at Greenwich. St. 
Paul's was in a state of decay ; the King and Laud wished 
him to rebuild it completely, and his portico was intended 
as an instalment of the new building. The nave of old 
St. Paul's had been long used as a lounge, for gossiping, for 
servants seeking places, and for people unable to afford a 
dinner, who were said to dine with Duke Humphrey, 
believed to have been buried there, though his tomb has 
since been identified at St. Albans. The new portico was 
intended to provide this public accommodation outside 
the church; arid, to make room for it, Jones removed the 
Church of St. Gregory, which stood in front of it, in a 
somewhat high-handed manner, for which he had after- 
wards to answer. 

The Queen's house at Greenwich was begun by Anne of 
Denmark, and completed by Henrietta Maria, whose name, 
and the date 1635, the period of its completion, are still on 

1 As I write, the Board of Works talk of raising its level, to form an entrance to 
Buckingham Street. Better let it remain as the old landmark of the river. Though 
it will stand if let alone, it will not bear reconstruction.

the front of the building. It is the central portion of the 
hospital, now the naval school. The present west side of 
the great square was built by Webb for Charles II., it is 
said from Jones' design. 

In 1631 he commenced the Church of St. Paul's in Co vent 
Garden, which was not finished till 1638. As he designed 
it it was of brick with a red tile roof, the columns of the 
portico and other parts of stone. Lord Burlington repaired 
it with care and reverence in 1727; and in 1795, on its total 
destruction by fire, it was rebuilt of stone, by the elder 
Hardwick, on the plan and proportions of the original 
structure. The piazza of Coveiit Garden was from his 
design originally with stone columns on a red brick wall. 
These have been covered with paint and plaster, and are 
now being removed. 

Few great architects have been so unlucky. Almoj 
nothing that he planned was finished, and his works have 
been altered or rebuilt. In 1642 the Civil War broke out 
and stopped all building. He joined the King's party he 
was a Roman Catholic, and was taken prisoner at the siege 
of Basing. 1 He died at Somerset House in June 1652, in his 
seventy-ninth year, and was buried beside his father and 
mother, in the church of St. Benet, Paul's Wharf. 

Inigo Jones fell on evil times for art. Its quiet music 
was drowned in the noise of battles and the strife of parties. 
The nation had more important things to attend to. Had 
the King, Charles I., had his way ; had he been allowed 
scope for his artistic tastes, by the help of the foreign 
painters whose works he admired, and with the genius oi 
Inigo Jones and the trained workmen of the time to carry 
out their ideas in splendid buildings and works of art, Eng- 
land might have become a home of the arts. But to give 
absolute power to the Crown was too high a price for 
Englishmen to pay for this. Whitehall would have been

THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 301 

one of the noblest palaces in Europe. Had it been built 
it would have settled for us, in a way we might have been 
proud of, the still unsettled question of Government build- 
ings in Westminster, and would have given a higher tone 
to all the architecture of the country. There was skill in 
art, and an appreciation of it in the country at the time, 
sufficient to have realised a splendid palace both in details 
and decoration. But, seeing what its completion would 
have cost us politically, few Englishmen will regret that the 
conception was never realised. Is it too much to hope that 
the Government offices, which remain to be built, may 
have something of the beauty and refinement which Inigo 
Jones would have given us, with greater suitableness for 
our modern purposes than his great palace would have had ? 

The troubles which prevented the building of Whitehall 
prevented the carrying out of architectural works through- 
out the country. In some few cases Inigo Jones' designs 
were carried out, but for the most part they exist only on 
paper. 

I have copied from the book of his designs published by 
Kent, the plans and elevation of a house for the Duke of 
Queensberry. 1 Mr. Fergusson decides, from what he thinks 
the inferior merit of the design (figs. 97 and 99, pp. 304, 305), 
that it is not Jones', but probably Webb's. I do not pretend 
to the same insight, but it is historically interesting, because 
it illustrates what was, till the Gothic revival, the general 
type of English country mansions. The distinctive feature 
is the portico in front. For the next hundred years no 
gentleman's mansion was complete without a portico. 

It is true that this was an unmeaning decoration, the 
feature is beautiful in itself, and it had been worked out by 
successive refinements to a high degree of perfection, but 
its proper use and purpose was gone. It is a " survival,'* 

1 In Campbell's 'Vitruvius Britannicus' the same design is entitled Amresbury, 
Wiltshire.

like what is said to occur in the animal kingdom, of organs 
now useless which had served necessary functions in other 
circumstances in an earlier stage of the animal's develop- 
ment. In this case the portico is utilised as a covered 
balcony from the great hall on the first floor (fig. 100), 
an expedient which has been repeated in the buildings 
of University College, in London, but with unhappy results 
in our climate, so far as comfort and convenience go. 
Almost every great mansion built in England in the last 
century had such a portico, blocking out the light from 
bedroom windows, and making the house look cold and 
damp. Yet undoubtedly it gives grandeur to the design. 

The back elevation in this design (fig. 99) is interesting, 
showing how a certain dignity of architectural effect can 
be produced by the simplest means without appearance of 
effort, for the position of the windows is determined, as 
may be seen by the plan, solely by the exigencies of the in- 
ternal arrangement. The windows in the rooms E and K 
are kept in the centre, irrespective of any considerations of 
symmetry outside. 

Short square windows, as in this design, in the upper 
story, or attic, as it is architecturally called, continued long a 
feature of Classic houses in this country. The horizontal 
band which they make gives a Classical effect, which would 
be destroyed by breaking them up through the cornice into 
the roof; while to increase the height of the building so as 
to make these windows taller, would spoil its proportions. 
But to have bedrooms dark and ill-ventilated, from the top 
of the windows being halfway down the wall inside is, 
perhaps, too high a price to pay for architectural proportion. 
The practice of the French Kenaissance, of raising dormer 
windows above the line of the cornice, is more practical 
and better suited for our adoption. 

The designs of Inigo Jones thoroughly carry out the 
Classic principle of symmetry. It is a principle of all forms

and types of architecture, as it is of animal organisation. 
It is essential to the highest dignity of great buildings, and 
it gives some even to small and simple ones. Among Jones' 
designs published by Kent there are some simple farm- 
steadings to which a really grand architectural effect is 
given by arranging the farm-buildings and enclosures with 
perfect symmetry on each side of the farmhouse. 

It is an error to suppose that symmetry was not aimed at 
in Gothic buildings, though the architects felt that it was 
not essential in every case ; as when of the two western 
towers of a cathedral which had originally been intended, 
they carried up only one, as at Strassburg, preferring the 
glory of height to symmetry, and feeling that two such 
high steeples would be absurd, as I fear that the two great 
steeples of Cologne may prove when they are finished. The 
old architects, if they had built both steeples, would have 
made them different in design. l 

With our Gothic train ing we no longer consider symmetry 
essential, and think it even foolish to make the stables on 
one side of a house appear like a repetition of the kitchen 
offices on the other. The Gothic practice of allowing the 
internal arrangements to control the dispositions of the ex- 
terior architecture is a safer guide in house-planning, and 
more likely to attain satisfactory results in comfort and 
convenience than the Classic principle of making the in- 
ternal arrangements fit in as best they may to the design of 
the outside. 

The inner court of St. John's College at Oxford (fig. 101) 
is said to have been built by Inigo Jones. - It was com- 
menced in 1631, as we know from an entry in Laud's diary, 
" A.D. 1632, Julii 26: The first stone was laid of my build- 
ing at St. John's." The next entry referring to the building 

1 Before the recent carrrying up of the north tower at Cologne, it was to be seen 
that the mediaeval architects had given up all idea of making it similar to the south 
one, but the restorers destroyed the portions which varied in design from the 
opposite tower, and made both alike.

is on the 3rd of September, 1635, when he goes to St. John's 
from Cudsden, where he was staying, " to see my building 
there, and to give some directions for the last finishing of it." 
It is a charming building, happily still one of the few re- 
maining in Oxford from which the colour and picturesque- 
ness of age have not been removed by modern restoration. 
Its Gothic character is sometimes accounted for by supposing 
that it is an early work, before his second visit to Italy had 
taught him purer Classic. But dates disprove this suppo- 
sition. He may have given a sketch for it, but when we 
know that before this date he had designed Whitehall 
and St. Paul's portico, it is impossible to believe that this 
building was carried out according to his ideas. 1 

It is true that, ten years earlier, he had designed the 
Gothic chapel of Lincoln's Inn. But that is not, like the 
Gothic parts of St. John's College, in the traditional styl&lt; 
of the period, but an imitation of an older style mix&lt; 
with correct Classic work. 

The upper story of St. John's, with its Perpendici 
windows and cornice and battlements, is clearly the pi 
duction of the workman of the period, following the ti 
tional style. The general design of the Classic centi 
porch and arcade, may have been suggested by him, but tl 
details, though effective, are too far removed from Class 
correctness and elegance to have been designed by tin 
same hand which drew those of the buildings we kn&lt;y 
to be his, or by any one who had studied to good pur] 
in Italy. 

So long as - there was a living style of architecture, tl 
is what would naturally happen. Every workman, withoi 
any drawings, knew how to cut the ordinary tradition* 
mouldings, and it would have required much trouble an 

1 Laud says nothing of any architect, nor does Anthony Wood in his elal 
account of the College in his History. In the notes to Wood by Glitch, about 
century ago, the tradition appears ascribing it to Inigo Jones. 



THE KENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 311 

constant personal supervision to make him work in any 
other way. 

In Wren's time there is a note of the change in the system 
of conducting architecture, by the architect supplying full- 
size drawings for the details, instead of following the old 
system arid allowing the workmen to carry out these accord- 
ing to their traditions. In a letter, quoted by Elmes in 
his life of Wren, to the authorities of Trinity College, 
Cambridge, in explanation of the plans he had submitted 
for the new library, Wren, says, "I suppose you have good 
masons, however, I would willingly take a farther pains 
to give all the mouldings in great, we are scrupulous in 
small matters ; and, you must pardon us, the architects are 
as great pedants as critics or heralds." It almost seems as 
if Wren thought an apology needed for wishing to supply 
full-sized drawings, and thus interfering with the established 
custom of letting the masons cut the mouldings according 
to their own ideas. 

Inigo Jones is said to have designed Heriot's Hospital 
in Edinburgh, commenced in 1628, and it is by no means 
improbable. Cunningham, in his Life, says the internal 
fittings of the council room are in his manner. But judging 
from their style they appear to me of later date, of the 
time of Charles II. and Grinling Gibbons. Jones may 
have furnished drawings for the general disposition and 
elevation of the buildings, but the Scotch workmen, who 
carried it out, have taken their own way, and built in their 
own traditional style. 

The general idea of the design of St. John's College, 
Oxford, is found elsewhere in England, as in the interesting 
little market cross of Peterborough (fig. 102). And it may 
have been a natural development of architecture in the 
circumstances of the times. For the arcades, the builders 
would see no difficulty in adopting the new ideas. They 
had merely to substitute a round arch for a Tudor arch ; but 






312

they might not see their way practically to manage the 
working of Classic windows without mullions. Just as GrotLic 
architects at present find it impossible to get their style 
thoroughly carried out, because people will not give up the 
sliding sash windows, to which they have been accustomed. 

During the Civil War and the Commonwealth (1642-60), 
there was little building. What was done was done in

the traditional manner, people not troubling themselves 
with art or its professors. With the restoration of Charles 
II., and the return to power of an aristocracy, who con- 
sidered themselves patrons of the arts, the interest in the 
new style revived. During his reign it became the ac- 
cepted style of domestic architecture in London. In country 
parts, and occasionally at Oxford, long afterwards, the old 
style was still clung to. The Great Fire of London, in 1666, 
was a notable event in the history of architecture. It put 
an end to the building of wooden houses in the town, made 
brick the common building material of England, and spread 



THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 313 

the fashion of Classic houses. It gave to Sir Christopher 
Wren one of the finest opportunities any architect has ever 
had, and he proved himself not unworthy of it. 

He was then thirty-four years old, having been horn in 
1632, at Knoyle in Wiltshire, where his father, who was 
in the same year made Dean of Windsor, was rector. 
The family were ardent Royalists. His uncle, Matthew 
Wren, Bishop of Ely, was charged before Parliament with 
High-church practices ; turning to the east, and holding the 
consecrated bread over his head for the adoration of the 
people ; with discouraging preaching in his diocese ; and 
with encouraging sports on Sunday afternoons. He was not 
brought to trial, but remained twenty years in prison, till 
Cromwell's death, refusing the conditions on which he might 
have had his liberty. 1 

Wren, being delicate in health, was educated at home, 
excepting a short time at Westminster School. While a 
boy he was remarkable for his knowledge and invention in 
every branch of science. In his thirteenth year he invented 
a new mathematical instrument, which he dedicated to his 
father in a Latin address. In 1647, when he was fifteen, 
he was appointed demonstrating assistant by the Lecturer 
on Anatomy, at Surgeon's Hall. Anatomical drawings 
of his are extant, and he afterwards made discoveries in 
Anatomy. He made inventions in the use of the microscope, 
studied chemistry, and was an excellent mathematician. 
In his twenty-fifth year he was appointed Professor ot 
Astronomy at Gresham College, and afterwards Savilian

Professor of Astronomy at Oxford. He was an active 
member and an early president of the Royal Society, 
founded immediately after the Restoration, and he was 
constantly bringing before it new inventions of his own 
in all branches of human knowledge. 

Evelyn at Oxford, in 1654, says in his Diary: "After 
dinner I visited that miracle of a youth, Mr. Christopher 
Wren, nephew to the Bishop of Ely." In his Sculptura, 
he calls him " that rare and early prodigy of universal 
genius, Mr. Christopher Wren, our worthy and accomplished 
friend." 

Wren's first employment as an architect seems to have 
been in 1661, when the King, on his Restoration, sent for 
him from Oxford to assist Sir John Denham, Surveyor- 
General of His Majesty's Works, in the repairs of St. Paul's 
and Windsor Castle, and in building a new palace at 
Greenwich. Denham had been promised the reversion of 
the post by Charles I., for his loyalty rather than his 
capacity, of which Evelyn, who speaks somewhat con- 
temptuously of his proposals for Greenwich Hospital (Diary, 
Oct. 19th, 1661), " though he had Mr. Webb, Inigo Jones' 
man to assist him," had a low opinion. 

There seems to be no record of how or where Wren got 
his practical knowledge of architecture. It was part of the 
polite learning of the day, and there is some evidence that 
his father, in 1634, designed a building for the Queen of 
Charles I., which apparently was not erected. It is not 
unreasonable to suppose that his father's interest in the art 
would give the son opportunities of which his enormous 
powers of acquisition and invention would make the most. 

In 1663 he was appointed assistant Surveyor-General, to 
do Denham's work ; and, having refused an offer to go to 
Tangier to fortify it and construct the mole there, of which 
Pepys speaks so frequently in his Diary, he was appointed 
to superintend the repairs of St. Paul's. The church was 



THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 315 

in a bad state, notwithstanding that Inigo Jones had cased 
a good part of it with Portland stone, and had rebuilt the 
north and south fronts, as well as the portico at the west 
end. The roof, as appears from an account of Wren's, was 
ruinous, the pillars bent from their " ill-building with small 
rubbish stones and much mortar, and cased only with 
small stones." But his proposals for its repair would not 
commend themselves to us. He wished, " by cutting off the 
corners of the cross, to reduce the middle part into a spacious 
dome or rotunda, with a cupola or hemispherical roof, and 
upon the cupola (for the outward ornament) a lantern with 
a spring top to rise proportionally, though not to that un- 
necessary height of the former spire of timber and lead, 
burnt by lightning." " I would not," he continues, " persuade 
the tower to be pulled down at first, but the new work to 
be built round it, partly because the expectations of people 
are to be kept up ; for many unbelievers would bewail 
the loss of old Paul's steeple, and despond if they did not 
see a hopeful successor rise in its stead." Not much, 
apparently, would have been left us of old St. Paul's, even 
without the Great Fire. 

In May, 1663, he exhibited a model for the Sheldonian 
Theatre at Oxford, not finished till 1669, the great roof of 
which of 90 feet span is still a marvel of construction ; and 
in April the first stone was laid of the Chapel of Pembroke 
Hall, at Cambridge. Though this was Wren's first building ; 
I believe it was actually in contemplation by the college 
authorities to pull it down, as they have done the old hall, 
and other most interesting parts of the College, replacing 
them by modern work by Mr. Waterhouse. 

In the summer of 1665 he visited Paris, where he occupied 
himself, as he says in a letter to a friend, 1 "in surveying the 
most esteemed fabrics of the city and the country round." 
Versailles did not please him. " The women, as they make

here the language and fashions, and meddle with politics 
and philosophy, so they sway also in architecture ; works of 
Filgrand and little knacks are in great vogue, but building 
certainly ought to have the attribute of eternal, and 
therefore the only thing incapable of new fashions." He 
seems unconscious that he was himself inventing new 
fashions in architecture. " After the incomparable villas 
of Yaux and Maisons, I shall but name Kuel, Couzance, 
Chilly, Essoans, St. Maur, St. Mande, Issy, Meudon, Rincy, 
Chantilly, Verneul, Lioncour ; all of which, and I might 
add many others, I have surveyed ; and that I might not 
lose the impressions of them, I shall bring you almost all 
France on paper, which I found, by some or other, ready 
designed to my hand. Bernini's design for the Louvre I 
would have given my skin for, but the old reserved Italia] 
gave me but a few minutes' view. I shall be able, by 
course and a crayon, to give you a tolerable account of it." 

He had returned to London in March 1666. He does nol 
seem to have thought of going to Italy. " The works going 
on in Paris," he says, "make a school of architecture the 
best probably at this day in Europe " (Parentalia, p. 261), 
On August 27, he made a survey of St. Paul's, with Evelyi 
and others of the commissioners, who reported in favoi 
of replacing it by Wren's cupola, though some wished to 
reinstate the spire. On September 6th the Great Fire of 
London, which had been burning since September 2nd, 
settled the dispute by destroying St. Paul's. 

The remainder of Wren's life, for the next fifty-sevei 
years, was spent in rebuilding what the fire had burnt. 

Acting as surveyor-general, the duties of which office seei 
to have included many of those at present exercised by th( 
Metropolitan Board of Works, he submitted to the King 0] 
the 18th of the same month a plan for rebuilding the city. 2 

He proposed a " key " or embankment along the river,

THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 317 

from the Temple to the Tower, lined with the Halls of the 
City Companies the great lines of traffic widened and 
improved, with " piazzas " at their junctions. But the 
rights of individuals were too strong in England to make 
the scheme practicable. 

Attempts were still made to patch up old St. Paul's. In 
1668 parts of it threatened to fall, and Wren was sent for 
in great haste from Oxford to advise ; but it was not till 
1675 that the plan of the new church was decided on, Wren 
appointed architect, and the work commenced. The first 
service in the new church was held in 1698, twenty-four 
years afterwards and in 1710, when Wren was in his 
seventy-eighth year, the top stone of the lantern was laid 
in his presence by his son. 

During this time, besides other works, he rebuilt fifty-two 
parish churches in London ; many of the halls of the Mer- 
chant Companies ; the hospitals at Greenwich and Chelsea ; 
King William's Palace at Hampton Court; Marlborough 
House arid a few private houses ; among them the Earl of 
Orford's house at St. James's ; the Duchess of Buckingham's, 
in St. James' Park, and the large mansion on the south 
side of Queen Square, Bloomsbury, for Lord Newcastle, 
the plans for which are among his drawings at All Souls' 
College, Oxford. 

In 1718, the Court influence round George I. deprived 
him of his post. In February 1723, he died at the age of 
ninety-one. 

Although Wren thought that " Building ought to have 
the attribute of eternal, and therefore the only thing 
incapable of new fashions," few architects have shown 
greater originality. The variety in the design of his steeples 
is marvellous. That of St. Magnus, London Bridge, built, 
according to Elmes, in Queen Anne's time in 1705, is a fair 
specimen of his style (fig. 103). With his age he accepted the 
authority of the Classic orders, but his irrepressible invention 



318 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



made a new architecture out of them. His skill in con- 
struction made him equal to the most difficult problems ; his 

fecundity of invention in art 
was governed by a sense of 
proportion and beauty. We 
laugh at his Gothic. We can 
copy better old Gothic mould- 
ings, but his Gothic towers 
are admirable in outline, 
which unhappily our modern 
ones seldom are. His Classic 
mouldings are always ex- 
cellent ; full and flowing in 
their contours, without the 
delicacy of the Greek. Many 
of the forms which be used, 
as for example, his windows, 
are those of the French archi- 
tecture of his day France, 
we saw, he thought the best 
school in Europe but in- 
stead of their sometimes 
feeble elegance, he imparted 
to them an English masculine 
vigour. 

In his works, there is a 
commonsense practicalness 
which render them always 
satisfactory. Merchant 
Taylors' School, lately de- 
stroyed, which he built im- 
mediately after the Great 
Fire, is an eminently sensible

Graphic' (figs. 104, 105, 106). It was built cheaply ; with no 
expenditure on ornament except the Doric pilasters on the 
street front (fig. 104) and a few mouldings and cornices, but 
these were admirable in their contour. The interior (fig. 106),

though quite simple, is very dignified. The great door in 
the end, which was of excellent design and well carved, and 
the high panelling give a feeling of art and comfort 
different from the dreary interiors of most modern schools. 



320

The mode of dividing the window-panes seems to me to be 
an alteration of a later date. 1 

Wren so trained a school of workmen that Classic be- 
came their traditional 
style, which they 
could carry out with- 
out drawings. This 
is the only practical 
method of producing 
art -workmen. The 
South Kensington 
system of trying to 
make each workman 
an artist, capable of 
invention, has hither- 
to produced only fail- 
ure, and can never 
have any other re- 
sult. The original in- 
ventors in any age 
I must always be few. 
To produce good 
architecture gene- 
rally, their inven- 
tions should be learnt 
arid thoroughly un- 
derstood by ordinary 
builders and work- 
men, so that they 
become part of their 
traditions and habits. The old system of apprenticeship 
accomplished this. Failing this, we are dependent on the 
modern system of architects directing the building to its 
minutest details by means of drawings, which presupposes

1 I have since learned that thev were altered in 1852. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 323 

that all architects are original inventors. If they .are, this 
age is richer in originality than any previous one. The 
condition of modern architecture does not bear out this 
supposition. 

Wren introduced Italians for sculpture and decoration, and 
developed a school of wood-carving under Grinling Gibbons. 

The stone carving at St. Paul's is the work of a school of 
carvers, admirable in its style, full and rich, without the 
perfection of line of the Italian, or the graceful delicacy 
of the French. In time the carving lost this fulness, in 
striving after elegance, and became, as in the Church of St. 
Mary-le-Strand, somewhat thin and weedy. 

The rich and splendid wood-carving was a special glory 
of the architecture of Wren's time. Grinling Gibbons was 
counted the best wood-carver of his day, though, as a part 
of architecture, his work seems to me too natural. Evelyn, 
then living at Deptford, discovered him, and Gibbons' work 
is so associated with the architecture of the time, that the 
story will not be thought out of place : 

" This day," Evelyn says in his Diary for January 18th, 

1671, " I first acquainted his Majesty with that incomparable 

young man Gibbons, whom I lately met with in an obscure 

place by mere accident as I was walking near a poor solitary 

thatched house, in a field in our parish, near Sayes Court. 1 I 

found him shut in ; but, looking in at the window, I perceived 

him carving that large cartoon or crucifix of Tintoretto, a 

copy of which I had myself brought from Venice, where the 

original painting remains. I asked if I might enter : he 

pened the door civilly to me, and I saw him about such a 

work as, for the curiosity of handling, drawing, and curious 

exactness, I never had before seen in all my travels. I 

[iiestioned him why he worked in such an obscure and 

onesome place ; he . told me it was that he might apply 

imself to his profession without interruption, and wondered 

1 Evelyn's house at Deptford, which came to him through his wife,

not a little how I found him out. I asked if he was un- 
willing to be made known to some great man, for that I 
believed it might turn to his profit ; he answered he was 
yet but a beginner, but would not be sorry to sell off that 
piece; on demanding the price, he said 100. In gooc 
earnest the very frame was worth 1he money, there bei 
nothing in nature so tender and delicate as the flowers anc 
festoons about it, and yet the work was very strong ; in th 
piece were more than one hundred figures of men, &amp;c. 
found he was likewise musical, and very civil, sober, and dis 
creet in his discourse. There was only an old woman in th 
house. So desiring leave to visit sometimes I went away. 

" 19th. February. This day dined with me Mr. Surveyor 
Dr. Christopher Wren, and Mr. Pepys' clerk of the Acts 
two extraordinary, ingenious and knowing persons, an 
other friends. I carried them to see the piece of carving 
which I had recommended to the King. 

" 1st. March. I caused Mr. Gibbons to bring to Whiteha] 
his excellent piece of carving, where being come, I advertise* 
his Majesty. * * * No sooner was he entered and cas 
his eyes on the work, but he was astonished at the curiosity 
of it, and having considered it a long time and discourse 
with Mr. Gribbons, whom I brought to kiss his hand, he com 
nianded it should be immediately carried to the Queen's sid 
to show her. It was carried up to her bed-chamber, wher 
she and the King looked on and admired it again ; the Kin 
being called away, he left us with the Queen believing sht 
would have bought it, it being a crucifix ; but when hij 
Majesty was gone, a French peddling woman, one Madam&lt; 
de Boord, who used to bring petticoats, and fans, and bauble 
out of France to the ladies, began to find fault with severa 
things in the work ; which she understood no more than ai 
ass or a monkey, so as in a kind of indignation I caused th 
person who brought it to carry it back to the chambei

woman, and this incomparable artist had his labour only 
for his pains, which not a little displeased me ; and he was 
fain to send it down to his cottage again ; he not long after 
sold it for 80, though worth 100 without the frame, to 
Sir George Yiner. 

" His Majesty's surveyor, Mr. Wren faithfully promised 
me to employ him. I having also bespoke his Majesty for 
his work at Windsor, which my friend Mr. May, the archi- 
tect there, was going to alter and repair universally ; for 
on the next day I had a fair opportunity of talking to his 
Majesty about it in the lobby, next the Queen's side, where 
I presented him with some sheets of my history." The 
remainder of the entry, though it does not refer to art, is 
interesting : " I thence walked with him, when I both 
saw and heard a very familiar discourse between [him] and 
Mrs. Nelly, as they called an impudent comedian ; she 
looking out of her garden on a terrace at the top of a wall " 
(where now is the Army and Navy Club), " and [he] 
standing on the green walk under it. I was heartily sorry 
at this scene. Thence the King walked to the Duchess of 
Cleveland, another lady of pleasure and curse of our nation." 

The following letter, quoted by Evelyn's editor, shows how 
things are managed in much the same way in every age :

Gibbons bad not bad much advantage of education. 
Walpole says it is uncertain wbetber be was born in 
Holland or England. Tbe errors in tbe letter are very 
English . 

Tbis digression may be pardoned for its own interest, and 
as bringing us into personal acquaintance witb tbe times 
and tbe men wbose works we are considering. 

In Wren's day Classic architecture became tbe vernacular 
of tbe country ; tbe mode wbicb every workman understood, 
and in wbicb be naturally worked. Tbis result was caused 
partly by the abandonment of tbe old practice of building 
in wood and plaster, witb wbicb tbe Gothic modes of work 
were associated in England, from the exhaustion of the 
forests as well as the dread of fire ; and partly from the new 
fashion, which had long been accepted by the rich and 
cultivated, descending in time to the people. 

Gothic buildings were still erected. Wren built many 
himself, the Tom tower at Cbrist Church, Oxford, and 
Gothic towers to churches; as did Hawksmoor after him. 
But these were conscious revivals to harmonise witb existing 
Gothic work, or to perpetuate a form which association had 
rendered dear. " Many unbelievers," as he said, " would 
bewail the loss of old Paul's steeple." But with these ex- 
ceptions, which are of the kind that prove the rule, tbe 
architects and masons of the day all worked in the same 
style. 

Old Bedlam, or Bethlehem Hospital, of the central block 
of which I give a drawing (fig. 107), is a fair specimen of 
the ordinary work of the day. I cannot find that it had 
any architect. It was begun in 1675, and finished in fifteen 
months, " which," says Maitland, in his history of London, 
" was considered wonderfully quick work," as well it might. 
Building is one of the arts in which mankind has not ad- 
vanced. Its excellence depends on traditional skill, which

enables the whole body of workmen to work together in 
concert ; each, by the teaching of his apprenticeship, know- 
ing his own trade, so that everything in the building, with- 
out special direction and without drawings, harmonises 
perfectly in style. Our modern progress is destructive of 
tradition. This building, now destroyed, was 540 feet long 
and 40 feet wide, broken by the pavilion, which, with its 
marked perpendicular lines, rose in the centre like a tower. 
The gate, 

"Where Gibber's brazen brainless brothers stand," 

was erected after the Union, as the supporters, representing 
the lion and unicorn, show. It is a pity this gate could not 
have been re-erected somewhere ; for it is an admirable 
design, and the statues of 
raving and melancholy mad- 
ness, though not the kind of 
decoration for an asylum 
which our kindlier treatment 
of lunacy finds appropriate, 
are powerful and interesting. 
They are preserved in the 
South Kensington Museum, 
but, having been designed for 
their position in the archi- 
tecture, they lose their value 
when removed from it. 

St. Catharine's Hall, or Col- 
lege, as the authorities call it, 
at Cambridge, commenced in 
1680, shows the same treat- 
ment of breaking the hori- 
zontal line of the building 

by a taller Classic frontispiece. It is of brick with stone 
dressings. Though later in date, it stills retains in its 
mullioned windows some Gothic character ; for here, as at

Oxford, old traditions continued. Till a few years ago 
St. Catharine's College was complete in style throughout, 
but its harmony was destroyed and its history falsified, by 
altering the chapel into quite incongruous Gothic. Its 
architecture may have been influenced by that of Clare

College beside it, which was being built at the time, the design 
of which, though not fully carried out till 1715, dates from 
1638, and shows mullions and other Gothic features, mingled 
with Classic, so as to produce a complete and characteristic 
English style. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 331 

Drapers' Hospital, near Margate, belonging to the 
Quakers (fig. 109), is a characteristic specimen of a type 
of English architecture which has lately acquired notoriety 
under the name of "Queen Anne." Whatever may be 
thought of its merits, it has claim, I think, to be called a 
true and national style. It is a builder's, not an archi- 
tect's, style, the product of traditions naturally developing 
themselves. At the end of the seventeenth century brick 
had become the common building material of the country, 
and Classic forms and mouldings the vernacular of the 
workmen, who, following apparently their own instincts, 
formed the style out of these elements, without drawings 
from architects, who were too learned to tolerate its bar- 
barism. In this instance, though the walls are of the usual 
flint building of the district, all the architectural parts are 
in brick, the grey and red making a beautiful contrast of 
colour. The style is common in the villages and cottages 
of the neighbourhood. 

The shaping of the gables into various curves, which is 
one of the characteristics of the style, is a simple and 
natural and consequently cheap mode of producing an effect 
in brick. It is one of the many ways in which the builders 
in every country, still inspired by the old Gothic freedom, 
got rid of the trammels of Classic rule. 

The later Italian architects, while not daring to alter the 
parts and proportions of the five orders, had, especially in 
the Jesuit churches, striven after richness and magnificence, 
by broken pediments and great curved scrolls. In France, 
in the style of Louis Quatorze, while the architecture under 
the dominion of orders continued correct and dull, the internal 
decoration revelled in a profusion of curved lines carried 
out into the forms of the panels and even of the window 
bars, where it was unconstructural and unmeaning. 

The same tendency to free curves shows itself in the 
Queen Anne style, which, though Classic in all its details, 



332 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

has in it something of Gothic character. It avoids the 
deeply set windows and dark shadows of Classic, and gets 
the sense of continuous wall surface characteristic of Gothic 
by keeping the window frames flush with the walls, and 
making them part of the wall surface by covering them with 
thick sash bars. In this instance the windows are even more 
Gothic with their mullions and transoms and leaded lights. 

This Gothic character seems to have impressed some 
architect, who has lately had this building through his 
hands, for, since this drawing was made, he has attempted 
to improve it by alterations in the Gothic taste. The 
Gothic canopied tops to the gate-piers show the commence- 
ment of his work. He has spoilt its character by traceried 
windows and the earthly vanity of shields for coats of arms, 
thinking these, I suppose, suitable historical adjuncts of an 
old Quaker establishment. 

Kew Palace (fig. 110) is a more elaborate and archi- 
tectural example of the Queen Anne style. It is probably 
not the work of an architect, else it would have been more 
correct, but one of those productions of a builder which 
were denounced by persons of taste and knowledge as 
aberrations from the standard of Classic purity. The orders 
are incorrect, and even clumsy. There is no Classic pre- 
cedent for the curved gables of the roof; but it is a 
charming house, homely and yet dignified, built to live in, 
but yet pleasant to look on. 

The two houses at Olney (fig. Ill), in one of which the 
poet Cowper lived, have an air of neglect and squalor 
which make them less pleasant examples of the style. They 
date probably from early in the last century, the aprons 
under the windows being a common characteristic in Queen 
Anne's time. Though this and the key-stones give them 
some pretentious to architecture, they are probably the work 
of the builder of the period.

with their broad white frames and small window paries 
twinkling in the light, they suggest all the pleasant asso- 
ciations of an English home. Inside, unless where modern 
taste has altered them, there are pleasant parlours lined 
with panelling painted white ; roomy, comfortable bed- 
rooms; ample .cupboards and keeping places, and an excel- 
lent wine cellar. They do not come within the category 
of architectural buildings, according to our recent notions ; 
Classic orders and Gothic ornament are alike unknown to 
them. They are the natural outcome of simple brick 
building, in an age when the work of every workman, and

every moulding, however simple, was governed by traditions 
which secured it from offending against good taste. 

A notable feature of the Queen Anne style is its use ot 
cut brick for the mouldings and carving, which in Classic 
architecture are usually executed in stone. We have seen, 
that this was an old Roman practice (fig. 63, p. 208). A 
peculiar kind of brick is used for this kind of work, called 
" rubbers," granular and soft, but capable, as we see from 
some examples of carved capitals among the old buildings 
of the Temple, of standing several centuries of exposure 
without injury. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 337 

It may seem absurd and unreasonable to make up large 
blocks for mouldings and capitals out of such small materials 
as bricks, and it migbt appear better, if we cannot get 
stone, to mould them in large pieces of terra-cotta, as has 
been done with considerable success in -the Albert Hall and 
other buildings at South Kensington.' But cut brick pro- 
duces a different and, I think, more charming effect. Large 
pieces of terra-cotta, and even moulded bricks, are apt to 
twist in burning, it is difficult to get their lines true, and 
the colour is often unsatisfactory. Yellow terra-cotta is 
often beautiful, but the red and the moulded bricks are 
usually of a livid purply hue. In cut brick work the lines 
are true and clean and the colour a charming orange red. 

During the eighteenth century the Classic style became 
the style of the country it was used in all kinds of 
buildings, domestic, civil, and ecclesiastical it devel- 
oped into a national variety, and assumed a distinctively 
English type. 

By those who studied architecture and knew what Classic 
parity and elegance were, this process was considered mere 
degradation. The mouldings were not always given their 
proper parts and contours. The authorised proportions of 
the orders were not observed. English workmen gave the 
style a character in accordance with their own nature and 
common sense. 

The Town Hall in the centre of the large market place 
of South Shields on the Tyne (fig. 113), a place which 
never advanced any pretensions to being aesthetic, is a 
fair specimen of this common English style. It has no pre- 
tensions to elegance ; it is plain and even somewhat clumsy, 
but it is not without picturesqueness, and is an eminently 
common sense building The architecture is purely and 
naturally constructive; it has forgotten the orders &amp;nd 
their proportions, it thinks for itself. Mr. Fergusson might

think it ugly or beneath notice, but he could not criticise 
it as slavishly carrying out the rules of Classic, or using 
the unconstructional ornament of pilasters. It is interesting 
to compare it with another building, the Custom House at 
King's Lynn (fig. 114), of similar form and design, but 
of much greater beauty and elegance, of higher architec-

tural pretensions, and more in accordance with Classi&lt; 
rule. 

In the lower story we have the Classic arrangement oi

trave with the Eoman arch, which is certainly less logi&lt;

being filled in with a mullioned window. Over the entrance 
is a statue of Charles II., in whose reign the building was 
erected. 

The general treatment recalls the Arundel Museum at 
Oxford, and the buildings of the later style of Francis I. in 
France. 

The gradual pro- 
gression towards 
greater simplicity 
in the English Re- 
naissance, which 
can be traced es- 
pecially in more 
ordinary buildings, 
was occasionally in- 
terrupted by the 
greater learning 
and better know- 
ledge of some archi- 
tect or even by the 
introduction of a 
foreign style. 

The screen of 
Montague House, 
the old British Mu- 
seum (fig. 115), is 
obviously French in 
its architecture. It 
occupied the site of 

the present high railing which dwarfs the height of its 
Grecian successor, and shuts it up in a cage. This French 
character,, shown specially in the tall slated roofs, is due 
to its architect having been a Frenchman, Peter Paget, 
of Marseilles. The fashion of these tall French roofs never

took root in England till lately, in consequence, I believe, 
of the Gothic revival. 

This English Eenaissance style, to which accident has 
given the name of Queen Anne, but which commenced 
before her reign, and continued long after it, became the 
characteristic style of London. 

The Great Fire destroyed old London with its " post and 

pan " houses of 
wood and plaster, 
whitewashed every 
three years ; which 
had in old times 
given it the name 
of the White Town. 
That terrible lesson 
made peremptory 
the orders which 
had been frequently 
passed, but little 
observed, since the 
time of James I., 



that all ' houses 
should be of brick. 
London in its enor- 
mous growth, which 
began after the Restoration and has continued ever since, 
spread itself over the country, and absorbed outlying 
villages and towns. All the houses were built in the new 
style, which applied the rules of Classic, as far as they would 
conveniently go, to building in brick. This style continued 
in a process of natural change and growth till the time of 
George IV. 

At first it retained something of Gothic pictures'queness, 
as appears in the old street (fig. 116), now destroyed, which

Jed from the Strand to the river, near Waterloo Bridge. 
The narrow windows, at the corner of the house to the 
right, show a common feature of the style, due to the old 
Gothic ideas still influencing the builders, quite at variance 
with the Classic rule that all windows in a row should be 
equidistant and of equal size irrespective of the size of the 
apartment which they lit. 

Gradually the style became more correct. The windows 
were made uniform, not only in the same house, but in the

whole row. As the houses were built by the yard for sale, 
there was no reason for making one different from another. 
They lost their individuality, and the process was encouraged 
by the foolish building conditions of ground landlords, in- 
sisting that streets should be built uniform, according to an 
elevation which they furnished ; so that in time the style 
was degraded to the dreary uniformity of Gower Street. 

Yet it is a true style, correct and in harmony, to the 
smallest particular. Every moulding is right in its own

way, and tells its place and date in the gradual progress. 
It avoided bad taste. The highest compliment that could 
be paid to art or ornament in that age, was that it should 
be "chaste," till architecture in fear of offending became 
absolutely dull and colourless. 

In its dullest examples there is character and even dignity, 
as in the tall wrought-iron railings, the delicate balconies, 
and especially the entrance doors, on which was con- 
centrated what little architectural ornament was expended 
on each house. 

These doorways were different in every house, giving 
each house individuality, notwithstanding the general 
sameness of the street and they were beautiful, sometimes 
even noble examples of design. In this respect these 
houses were better than those of our builders, which are 
ornamented all over with stucco only, it is true but

343

DOORWAY IN ESSEX STREET, STRAND. 



all in the row absolutely alike, so that a man knows his 
own house only by the number on the door. 

Of these doors I give three specimens, all from one little 
street, Cecil Street, Strand. They date from early in the 
eighteenth century, and very fairly illustrate the general 
character (figs. 117, 118, 119). 

Except in some few more magnificent examples, these 
doorways in the old houses are always made of wood. 
This is forbidden now, by the London Building Act ; some- 
what needlessly, I think ; the danger of their spreading 
fire not being obvious. The joiner work in the style, as 
in the internal fittings, is generally architectural, and more 
Classic than the brick and stone building. A universal 
feature in all these doors is the window above, lighting 
the passage, filled with delicate wooden tracery; always 
of playful and pretty design, and in many cases showing 



344 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



marvellous examples of delicate wood-work. These windows 
are part of the architecture of the door, and essential to its 
beauty. By a rule of the Portman estate, before a new 
lease was granted by the ground landlord, the tenant was 
compelled to improve the property, by clearing out this 
tracery and substituting a single sheet of plate glass a 
curious instance of stupid destructiveness. 

But the street architecture of the style was governed, to 
an extent Lord Bacon never meant, by his rnaxim that 
" houses are built to live in, not to look on." With the 
exception of the doorways (and when the style was dying 
out in the beginning of the century, no trouble was taken 
even with them), the fronts were absolutely plain. In 
the interiors neither trouble nor expense is spared in the 
design and ornament. 

The ceilings are covered with delicately moulded plaster 
ornaments of leaves and sprays, and figures, specially 
designed for each room. The chimney-pieces are of marble 
inlaid in different colours, and excellently carved. The 
doors are of solid mahogany, the panel mouldings carved 
with egg and tongue, the architraves and cappings 
painted white like the other wood-work of the room, which 
brings out the contour of the mouldings. Every room 
is designed and treated architecturally, with a panelled 
surbase or dado round it, which was seen through the open 
carved backs of the chairs, and with an enriched and well- 
proportioned frieze and cornice. People cared more for 
these things then than they do now. They gave them 
thought and care, and spent their money on them. It was 
easier then than now to get them well-designed and all 
in keeping ; for the style was a living one, understood by 
every workman, who worked as he had been trained, in 
harmony with his fellows. Some designers may have been 
better than others ; acknowledged as masters of the style 
and setting new fashions, like the Brothers Adam. But the 



THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 345 

work which is not theirs is similar in style, and they could 
not have carried out the work they are credited with, all 
over the three kingdoms, so completely, unless the style had 
been everywhere familiar to the workmen. There are still 
in London many such interiors as I have described, some 
turned to base uses, in districts now unfashionable, while 
others, alas ! have been improved by the modern builder, 
surbase torn down, the delicate white marble chimney- 
&gt;iece replaced by one of enamelled slate, with a gigantic 
shelf and clumsy consoles ; and a new cornice substituted, 
with coarse mouldings and vulgar ornament, for the old one 
which had been proportioned to the room. 

The Adam style of interior decoration has of late become 
fashionable again. It is chaste and elegant, but rather 
feeble. The same attenuated ornament is used in every 
position and in every material ; for plaster cornices and 
ceilings, the mantle-pieces and fire-grates and the wood-work 
of doors and surbases. In the modern revival of the style 
the examples frequently miss one chief merit of the older 
work, the consistency with which it was carried out into 
every detail of ornament and furniture. 

During the Eegency (1811-1819), there was a revival of 
street architecture ; a part of that general awakening from 
eighteenth century dulness, which the French Revolution 
everywhere caused. By this time G-reek architecture, which 
Stuart and Revett had discovered, had come to be under- 
stood, and was perceived to be different in principle and 
form from the Roman, with which, since the Renaissance, it 
had been supposed to be identical. It was seen to be more 
refined and beautiful ; that it rejected the use of the arch, 
and of brick as a building material, and used great stone 
lintels as the only means of spanning openings. People had 
become tired of the meanness to which brick architecture 
had degenerated, and the wilderness of grey stocks which 
London had become. But stone, especially of the dimensions 



346 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



which Greek architecture required, was impossible in London 
houses ; but the appearance of it could be got by stucco, for 
which there is Roman and even Greek authority. The 
brightness of the new white buildings charmed every one ; 
and if, in looking at examples of them (such as the terraces 
round the Regent's Park or on the cliffs of Brighton, which 
were among the first fruits of the movement), we can 
divest ourselves for the moment of our present ideas and 
forget that they are shams, we must admit that they exhibit 
something of the brightness, and even of the grandeur of 
Classic architecture. The builders, as usual, followed the 
fashion, and carried out the new style, in their rows of 
houses, in worse architecture and meaner design. Ground 
landlords, in letting their land for building, insisted on its 
adoption in the new streets, and for the next thirty or forty 
years it was the common London style. 

One element of grandeur was sought for by designing a 
row of houses as if it were one single great building, with 
a great pediment in the centre and symmetrical wings on 
each side flanked by propylcea. This grand design was 
apportioned equally among the several houses, the division 
giving perhaps to one house two windows out of the wings, 
and another under a corner of the pediment. To prevent 
this absurdity being apparent, which would have spoiled 
the effect of the architecture, a clause was inserted in each 
lease that the owners should all use the same colour in 
painting their houses. But the workman was not always 
successful in matching the colour, or the houses being painted 
in different years the various degrees of dirtiness made the 
deception obvious. 

This palatial style was carried out with better effect in 
the squares and crescents of Edinburgh, which were built 
about the same time. G-reek architecture was studied there 
with enthusiasm, and reproduced with knowledge and in- 
vention in adapting it to modern use. The splendid quarries 



THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 347 

of Craigleith furnished blocks of stone large enough for 
the columns and lintels of an order occupying the height of 
two stories. The result, as in Moray Place, has nothing 
of the meanness which their material gives to the London 
examples, but there is an air of gloomy aristocratic grandeur 
which the present age has found depressing. Even here 
a difference in the colour of the window-blinds exposed 
the deception of the design. Internally the requirements 
of the architecture were inconvenient, restricting the ap- 
parent number of stories, and making the windows of the 
upper floors look out on a gutter and blank parapet wall in 
order to conceal them. 

In London, the brightness of the clean white-painted 
fronts of the new architecture was an improvement on the 
dinginess of the mean fronts of grey stock bricks. But the 
obligation on the owners to paint the outside of their houses 
once in every three years (for which there was precedent 
in a similar rule in old white- washed London) was found 
onerous. The stucco or cement occasionally fell off in great 
flakes, and was expensive to repair. 

Of late the builders have got over this difficulty, still 
keeping the houses white, which was supposed to be the 
only proper colour for architecture, by facing the walls with 
white bricks and limiting the stucco to the architrave 
mouldings round the windows, the cornices, the corners, and 
the Classic columns of the porticos. The ingenuity of man 
has never produced a form of architecture more dismal and 
contrary to common sense ; for the bricks, white at first, 
soon become a dirty grey, like dirty linen ; and the meaning 
of architraves and cornices in architecture is, that being the 
exposed parts, they should be of harder and better materials 
than the walls of the building. But stucco is meaner than 
brick, and more easily chipped. The right arrangement of 
the materials would be to cover the walls with stucco, where 
it is useful to keep out the damp, and to make the corners 



348 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



and cornices of brick or stone. Some noble buildings, Hive 
the Palace of the Uffizzi, at Florence, have been designed 
on this principle. 

The Gothic revival of the last twenty years, though a 
whole generation of architects have been trained in it and 
practised it, has had no appreciable influence on street 
architecture. The builders would not risk building Gothic 
houses for sale, and, I think they were right. Artistic 
publicans have occasionally adopted it for public-houses ; 
but the result has not been gratifying to the lovers of the 
style. 

Within the last year or two there has been a revival of 
the " Queen Anne " style for town houses, and even for 
streets. The fashion seems to be spreading. It has received 
some accession of force from the schools of the London 
School Board, planted in every district of London, having 
been mostly built in that style. For the architecture of a 
few of the earliest of these I am responsible, having found 
by the practical experience of a house I built for myself 
in this manner, that the style adapts itself to every modern 
necessity and convenience. In that case I made no attempt 
to follow any particular style, the style grew naturally from 
using the ordinary materials and modes of work, and 
trying to give them character and interest. It is as pliable 
as Gothic, having inherited its freedom. Large windows 
or small, wide or narrow, with mullions or without them, 
arched or square-headed, with sliding sashes or hinged 
casements, with sash-bars or leaded glazing may be used in 
it as convenience or fancy dictates. 

Though some of its forms are adapted for stone, it is 
properly a brick style, and therefore specially suited for 
London houses. Ground landlords have favoured it and 
encouraged its adoption, insisting that the new houses on 
their estates should be built in red brick. But red brick- 
is by no means essential. Great masses of it, especially 



THE RENAISSANCE IN ENGLAND. 349 

when pointed with black mortar which gives the building 
a purple hue, almost hurt the eyes with their glare. 
Pleasant colour, I think, is got by dark brown stock bricks 
for the walls, and red bricks for the angles and cornices. 
The addition of black completes the harmony. But there is 
no need to use black bricks for the purpose, as the London 
atmosphere may be trusted to supply it. The black does 
not give an impression of dirt, for it is not, as Lord 
Palmerston defined dirt : " Matter in the wrong place," 
and an effect of cleanness and brightness is given to the 
building by the white window frames and sash-bars, which 
can be re-painted at trifling cost, their whole surface being 
small. 

It is a first condition of good architecture that the build- 
ing should weather well, that the effects on it of the 
atmosphere it is placed in should improve rather than spoil 
it. It should be like a part of its natural surroundings. 
Weather-worn stones, moss and grey lichens give many an 
old building a beauty which it had not when first built, 
and which it loses when it is restored. Even in towns, 
where smoke kills the lichens, it is possible to design so 
that it shall improve the building. St. Paul's is grander in 
the rich black of its base and the more than marble white- 
ness into which the weather has bleached it where it towers 
above the houses than it can have been when fresh and 
new. Polished granite or marble is soon dimmed and 
looks dirty. To keep them right they should be cleaned as 
often as the windows, which is impossible. 

I do not claim for this style that it is perfect, or that it 
expresses greatness and nobleness as some of the great 
styles of the world have done. It is rather simple and 

homely, 

" not too great or good, 
For human nature's daily food."

CHAPTER XIY. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN SCOTLAND, 



IT was a remarkable series of historical accidents which 
made the northern portion of our island a separate 
country from England, and its people a separate nation 
with a different national character, different laws, and a 
different form of religion. This was not caused by difference 
of race. The differences between Celts and Saxons within 
Scotland in race and character, and, what is even of more 
importance, in language, were far greater than those between 
the English and the Lowland Scots, who were in reality 
one people. The boundaries of the countries were long 
undefined. During the Heptarchy, the kingdom of Bernicia 
extended from the Humber to the Forth, and included 
Edinburgh. The Scottish crown in King Stephen's time 
had nearly acquired Northumberland and Cumberland. 
After the Norman Conquest, many barons held land in 
both countries, and did fealty to both kings. By a strange 
fatality, the project common in these days of uniting the 
whole island under one crown by a royal marriage was 
never realised. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN SCOTLAND. 351 

The wisdom of such a union was evident to statesmen, 
especially to one of the greatest, Edward I. But he took 
the wrong way to accomplish it ; the title on his tomb is 
Malleus Scotorum ; his attacks on Scotland, and the centuries 
of war they gave rise to, were the chief instruments which 
welded by hard blows the different races of the country 
into one nation. 

The names of its mountains and rivers show that Scotland 
had at some early period been overspread, like England and 
other countries, by the wave of Celtic immigration which 
passed over Europe. The ancient kingdom of Strath Clyde 
extended over Cumberland, and had relations, from com- 
munity of race and language, with Cornwall and Brittany. 
From another branch of the Celtic race, the Scots of 
Ireland, who conquered it about the sixth century, the 
country has its name. The name is now lost to its original 
land; but to Bede Scotland means Ireland. Duns Scotus 
was an Irishman. The Scots of Ireland established them- 
selves on the coast of Argyll, at the island fortress of Dun- 
staffnage, where, it is said, was first placed the stone seat 
on which the kings were crowned ; afterwards removed, as 
they pushed their conquests, to Scone, and by Edward I. 
to Westminster, in token of the transferrence to England of 
the royal power. 

The invasion of the Saxons only partially overspread 
the country. They did not readily amalgamate with the 
Celts. The boundaries of the two races were often sharply 
defined ; neighbouring villages spoke different languages, 
and did not understand each other. In Nairn, till lately, 
English was spoken in one half and Gaelic in the other 
half of the town. 

In Orkney and Sutherland the southern land from 
Norway the population was Norse, and on the west coast 
there were constant inroads of Norsemen. 

To these marked varieties of race, which are still apparent, 



352 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



is due the marked diversity of Scotch character. The 
Saxon steadiness and perseverance fostered by the struggles 
against a rugged soil and hard climate, which has conquered 
good positions everywhere, shows itself at times in the 
matter-of-factness, which cannot understand a joke, but 
oftener in a perfervid intensity of character which unites 
Teuton depth and toughness with Celtic fire. 

Left to themselves, without the pressure of foreign 
attacks, these discordant elements of the population would

have split asunder or been successively absorbed into the 
stronger kingdom of the south. That the attempts to 
subdue Scotland called out the resistance it did indicated a 
strength, even a grimiiess, which found expression in her 
religion, her art, and especially in her architecture. 

This severity of national character has generally been 
attributed to Calvinism and the Shorter Catechism. It 
would be truer to attribute the adoption of these to the 
national character, formed by the influence of a rugged 
land, by the struggles against a bleak climate, and grim 



THE RENAISSANCE IN SCOTLAND. 



353 



centuries of fighting for national existence, which forged 
light-hearted Celt and stolid Saxon into one stern nation. 

Scotch architecture gives the impression of grimness and 
severity which is usually credited to the character of the 
people. We see it in the solid windowless walls of this

old castle (fig. 120), and even the squalor of the back 
yard of a town slum (fig. 121) has a character and dignity 
which redeem it from vulgarity. Though they are full of 
windows, the walls like precipice cliffs of old Edinburgh 
houses of which the sketch in fig. 130, p. 374, shows a 
fragment somehow produce the same impression. They

354 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

are not ugly like Manchester cotton-mills, though quite as 
plain and devoid of ornament. 

Arrange their buildings as they would, plain as a 
cotton-mill or elaborate in ornament, the walls unbroken 
masses of stone or riddled with windows, in lord's castle 
or in back street, they all expressed the same national 
character. 

The form which the national Scotch style of architecture 
adopted was determined by political circumstances. The 
natural course would have been that the style should have 
spread over to Scotland from her richer and more civilised 
neighbours in the south, and for a time this was the case. 
The Norman style in the two countries is identical. The 
nave of Dunfermline Abbey is a copy of Durham Cathedral. 
The Norman castles in England and in Scotland are alike 
in plan and style. But the wars of England against both 
France and Scotland threw these two countries into an 
alliance, which would otherwise have been unnatural. The 
first evidence of a treaty between them is in 1326, twelve 
years after the battle of Bannockburn, but friendly com- 
munications had been commenced by Wallace, and it was 
fondly believed that the " ancient league" had originated in 
the time of Charlemagne. 

Before the time of Edward there are traces in the early 
Gothic architecture of Scotland of a sympathy with France 
rather than with England. In the groined roof of the 
crypt of Glasgow Cathedral, the filling-in of the vaulting is 
in the French, not in the English manner. 

A special peculiarity of Scotch architecture the steps 
running up the sides of the gables, forming their sky line 
into a series of nicks called " crow steps," in Scotch 
&lt;l corbie" steps has probably a French origin. The name 
seems French. It is possible that Scotland may have in- 
vented this feature for herself, but I have seen an earlier 
instance of it in France than any I know in Scotland. In 



THE RENAISSANCE IN SCOTLAND. 355 

France it was soon given up ; French domestic architecture, 
as we have seen, abandoning gables and preferring high 
conical slated roofs. In Scotland it continued and became a 
feature of her Renaissance style. Almost all the drawings 
which I give of Scotch buildings illustrate this feature. 
(See the gable in fig. 128, p. 369, of the first court of 
Glasgow College.) The courses of stone are left square at 
the ends, forming a row of steps up the side of the gable 
instead of being cut to its slope. It is a feature which 
could only have been developed in a stone country, where 
stone in courses was used for the commonest buildings in 
which no refinement was attempted, and the gables were 
left ragged in their outline without the finish of a 
4 'water-table," as it is called, of large flat stones, covering 
the top of the wall to protect it from wet. 

Like many other peculiarities of architecture, springing 
at first from mere rude workmanship, it became a feature 
of the style carried out at times with expense and elaboration, 
as when a projecting moulding is worked on each stone 
following the sky line of the gable. In this form of stept 
gable each step is a single stone, the outside stone of a 
course, differing therein from the steps of German gables 
which are larger, each being a piece of wall covered in 
with a flat water-table. 

In French architecture, gables, as we have seen, were 
superseded by slated roofs. But in Scotland a strong 
preference was always shown for them. Even when (as in 
Tilquhillie Castle, fig. 120, p. 352) the angles are rounded 
for defence, they are corbelled out to the square at the top 
to allow their being roofed with a gable. 

The gables with eaves projected over the face of the 
wall, to defend them from the wet, a special characteristic 
of wooden construction, were almost unknown in Scot- 
land. The country was being perpetually harried and 
burnt, generally by the Scotch themselves, as a means 

2 A 2 






35G 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



of defence. Bruce's advice was, not to give battle to the 
English invaders, but to burn the country before them, 
so as to starve them out. The houses therefore were built 
of stones without lirne, and a thatched roof, like highland 
cottages now, and burning them was little loss. The towers 
of the gentry, being built for defence, were stronger, but 
they were constructed so that, when burnt, little harm 
was done, the floors, resting on corbels independent of the 
wall, being easily replaced, and the roofs being sometimes 
of solid stone, which would not burn. Ecclesiastical build- 
ings were considered sacred from, such destruction, and 
though they were not always safe from the wild fury of 
the times, they were made as splendid as the poverty of 
the country could afford. 

In the later development of her Gothic architecture, 
Scotland, from the circumstances which determined her 
growth and existence as a nation, followed France rather 
than England. No great divergence is observable in the 
earlier varieties of Gothic. In all the northern countries 
of Europe, including Norway even, as shown by Drond- 
heim Cathedral, the styles are similar, but as soon as the 
peculiarly national styles became formed, Scotch Gothic 
becomes Flamboyant like the French, ruder perhaps and 
less elegant, with more of strength and severity. 

In both countries the high pointed vaulting was retained 
so long as the Gothic style lasted. In the shapes of the 
arch openings we find occasional examples of the flattened 
arch and depressed gable of the English Perpendicular, as 
was unavoidable from the proximity and occasional peace 
and friendship between the two countries ; but they are ex- 
ceptions. The prevailing form of the gable is moderately 
steep, not so sharp as the tall slated roofs of France. The 
arch openings are usually sharp-pointed as in the con- 
temporary French style, and the tracery has the flowing lines 
of the Flamboyant, not the straight bars of the Perpendicular. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN SCOTLAND. 357 

In Scotland, as in France, the east end of the churches 
was frequently terminated by an apse. Both in church and 
castle the style retained its mediaeval character of height 
and aspiration. For churches it was not subjected to the 
influence which in England flattened the roofs and arches. 
The castles, from the unsettled state of the country, could 
not become manor-houses, spread out over the ground, but 
continued lofty towers capable of defence. 

Late Scotch Gothic has a characteristic peculiar, I 
think, to itself in the frequent use of round arched open- 
ings, especially for doorways. Mr. Billings thinks this is 
a remaining trace of Norman. But that style had been 
abandoned centuries before, and revivals were not thought 
of in these days. It probably arose from the perception 
that, when the necessities of vaulting did not require a 
pointed arch, the semicircular form, especially for a door, 
was stronger and more suitable, more easily closed by bars, 
and avoided the high point hanging above the hinge. 

Another peculiarity of Scotch Gothic is the prevalence 
of square-headed windows without mullions, sometimes of 
fair width, without any attempt to disguise the straight 
lintel, as was usual in the Gothic of other countries, by 
cutting on it an ornamental pointed arch. These square- 
lintelled windows are found in monastic buildings and also 
in churches, though naturally they are more common in the 
castles. Borthwick Castle (iig. 122, p. 358), about thirteen 
miles from Edinburgh, was built in accordance with a licence 
obtained from James I. in 1430. It is a Gothic building, 
the roof of the great hall is a pointed waggon vault, and 
the details of the interior are late Gothic in character. The 
openings are not pointed, but square-headed and without 
mullions, and where an arch is needed, it is round. 

In Scotland, as in other countries, the characteristics of 
her Gothic style were inherited by her Renaissance. Some 






358 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



of them were already steps in the direction of the forms of 
classic, and they tended to make its adoption easier. The 
mullions, which are not a classic feature, were only gradually 
got rid of in France and England, as the classic tyranny 








Fig. 122. 



BORTHWICK CASTLE. 



became established and the styles lost something of their 
national character; but, as they were dispensed with in 
Scotch Gothic, there was no question of introducing them 
into her Renaissance. We find them occasionally, but they 
are not a characteristic of the style. 

The want of mullions in the style deprived it of the

359 



effect of continuous surface characteristic of Gothic, especially 
of late English Gothic, in which wall was carried over win- 
dow by mullions and tracery, and these mullions and tracery 
again carried over the wall, so that the whole building 
was one continuous surface. In Scotland, on the contrary, 
the windows are deeply recessed. The effect of the archi- 
tecture is obtained by their contrast with the walls, which is 
the principle of classic. 

This sketch (fig. 123), of an old house in Glasgow High 
Street, illustrates this treatment 
of the windows in the style, 
while at the same time the 
charming irregularity of their 
arrangement is thoroughly 
Gothic. 




OLD HOUSE IN GLASGOW 
HIGH STREET. 



The Renaissance in Scot- 
land, though we can trace in it 
many features of her Gothic 
style, was an importation from 
Prance of the Renaissance style 
of Francis I., after it had cast 
out Gothic features. 

Scotland had remained bar- 
barous longer than other parts 
of Europe, and when at last the new light of the Renais- 
sance reached her it came to her in French form. 

During the sixteenth century there was constant inter- 
course between the two countries, of which the marriage of 
James V. to the daughter of Francis I. and afterwards to 
Mary of Guise ; the upbringing of Mary Queen of Scots in 
France, and her marriage to the Dauphin was as much 
consequence as cause. 

In other spheres than architecture, Scotland was indebted 
to France for her civilisation ; she had not,, like England, a 



360 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



common law the growth of old rights and customs; this 
was prevented by the difference of race and language in 
her inhabitants, the Gaelic portion having their own tribal 
customs ; and by the barbarism consequent on the continual 
state of war with England, and the arbitrary power which 
this gave to the nobles as military leaders, who had top 
frequently the vices as well as the virtues of savages ; 
so that the country was kept almost in a state of anarchy. 
When at length she got laws, the complete system of 
Roman civil law was adopted as in France. 

In the Scotch language there are many traces of French 
influence, especially for articles of civilisation and luxury, 
and for terms of building. I have heard a Scotch work- 
man call the clock-face in a steeple, the " orledge," evidently 
from the French "horloge." 

The Scotch " Baronial " architecture, as it is called, 
resembles that of the Renaissance chateaux of France, and 
we are frequently told that such a noble built his castle 
in the French manner, or even employed a French architect. 
Newark Castle, on the Clyde, near Port Glasgow, is a fair 
example of the style. It dates probably from the end of 
the sixteenth or beginning of tbe seventeenth century, as 
the initials of the laird who held it at that time are intro- 
duced into its architecture. The round pepper-box turrets 
with conical roofs are common features in French Renais- 
sance. In both styles there is the same semblance of 
fortification, useless against cannon or even against the war 
engines of mediaeval times, though capable of withstanding 
a sudden attack from a hostile neighbour or a rising of the 
peasantry. The machicolations and the angle turrets have 
no openings at the bottom for throwing molten lead and 
missiles on assailants. The windows of the turrets are on 
the outer angle, not where they could enfilade the walls. 
It is a dwelling-house with large windows, unlike the 
mediaeval fortress. The lower part, being used for cellarage.

is a solid base with only a few small openings, which is a 
chief element in the character and dignity of the style ; but 
this is as much from old habit and from a preference for 
upper rooms for living in, as for defence. 




Fig, 124. 



NEWARK CASTLE, ON THE CLYDE. 



The details of the building are classic, treated with 
considerable freedom, and are but a rude reminiscence of 
French work ; but in its general character, in the pleasing 
irregularity of its windows, and in its effect of springing 
from the ground and expanding as it grows upwards, there 
are evident traces of the old Gothic influence, possibly 



362 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

borrowed anew from the French Renaissance, though more 
probably a remaining tradition of the country. 

The castle, illustrated in fig. 125, shows small trace of 
French Renaissance influence. It is eminently Scotch in 
character. The prominence of the perpendicular lines over 
the horizontal give it the growth and aspiration of Gothic. 
It is not a fortress ; the angle turrets are merely ornaments, 
a reminiscence or tradition which gives castellated dignity

to a dwelling-house. The style has features of its own, 
not borrowed from the French Renaissance. It did not 
adopt its tall pyramidal roofs, but retained stone gables and 
crow-steps, and it has a sternness and grandeur impressed 
on it by the country and the race, very different from the 
grace and elegance of the French style. 

It was during the seventeenth century that the greater 
number of the houses in the Scotch castellated style were 
built, the union of the crowns under James I. (1603) 
having at length given the country some repose and

THE RENAISSANCE IN SCOTLAND. 367 

opportunity of cultivating the amenities of life, and not- 
withstanding their suggestions of feudalism and appearance 
of fortification, the Scotch castles are really the signs of 
security and peace. 

The old buildings of Glasgow University were a charac- 
teristic example of the Scotch civil and domestic archi- 
tecture of the seventeenth century, specially interesting 
from the fact that the dates of the several portions are 
known from the muniments of the University ; and the 
progress of the style can thus he traced. 

The earliest portion of the buildings was the north side 
of the inner court, or u Close," as it was called, shown in 
fig. 126, p. 363, which was commenced in 1632, and with the 
eastern side appears to have been completed before 1639, 
when the civil troubles put a stop to the building. The 
eastern side was destroyed in the beginning of this century, 
and replaced by the commonplace building, part of which 
appears in the corner of the view. The old building had 
in the centre a large projecting oriel with mullions. 

When under the Commonwealth political and ecclesiastical 
aifairs got settled to the satisfaction of the Scotch, the works 
were commenced again, under Principal Gillespie, who 
showed indefatigable energy in collecting funds from all 
quarters, from the Lord Protector downwards. "Our 
gallant building," says Robert Baillie, one of the professors, 
writing in 1656, "goes on vigorously; above 26,000 
[pounds Scots only, let it be remembered] are already 
spent on it, Mr. Patrick Gillespie, with a very great care, 
industry, and dexterity, managing it himself as good as 
alone." About this year (1656), with the aid of a splendid 
legacy from Zachary Boyd and a large subscription from 
Thomas Hutcheson, the south and west sides of the inner 
court, shown in fig. 127, p. 366, were completed. The bust 
of Zachary Boyd was placed in a niche inserted in the tower 



368 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

over the entrance, apparently after the tower had been so 
far built, from its partly blocking up one of the windows. 
The money was given on condition that the university 
should print the donor's metrical paraphrase of the Bible 
in doggerel metre. The authorities thought the publication 
would not do credit to themselves, or the author. They 
kept the money, however, and complied with the behest 
by printing two copies only. 

The tower was partly erected by a contribution from 
Mr. Snell, the founder of the exhibitions to Balliol College, 
Oxford, which bear his name. It will be noticed that 
while the turret staircases and general features of the 
architecture are the same as on the opposite side of the 
court shown in the previous illustration, the pediments of 
the dormer windows have lost their classic simplicity of 
form, and have assumed the ornamental form characteristic 
of the Scotch style. 

This form of ornamental pediment is better shown in the 
next illustration (fig. 128, p. 369), which shows the corner 
of the outer court and part of the inner side of the beautiful 
hall which formed the front of the university buildings 
towards the High Street. These buildings were the next 
proceeded with ; their design dating probably from about 
1657. At the Restoration in 1660, Principal Grillespie was 
deprived of his office, without the satisfaction of being 
allowed to complete the great work which he had carried 
on so far with so much success. Not till 1690 was the 
great staircase leading to the Fore Hall completed by 
" a rail of stone balusters with a lion and a unicorn upon 
the first turn. The cost was 12 sterling, the College 
furnishing stone, lime, and materials." 

The design of this building is interesting from the 
manner in which the national style asserts itself in it over 
classic influence. The cloister is an example of Eoman 




ig. 128. OLD GLASGOW UNIVERSITY: STAIR TO FORE HALL. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN SCOTLAND. 373 

Doric faithfully conformed to classic rules. Its object 
being chiefly ornamental, it could afford to be foreign and 
fine. But for the parts that were to be lived in the common 
style of the builders was adhered to, being made, however, 
more splendid and ornamental than usual. 

Fig. 129, p. 372, shows the interior of the Fore Hall, as it 
was called, to which this great staircase led, though the 
illustration scarcely does the design justice, a charming large 
low room, panelled up to the cornice with dark oak. Instead 
of the cornice being placed as high as it might, the ceiling 
above it is coved, as if the aim of the designer had been to 
produce an impression of comfort rather than of height. 

The troubles which in Scotland followed the Restoration 
prevented anything more being done to the building till 
about the time of the Revolution of 1688. The steeple was 
provided with a clock, and was : probably raised and the 
upper clock face built at that time (see fig. 12V, p. 366). 
The square balusters on the tower are of the same character 
as those on the great stair which, as stated, were set up at 
this time. 

It is to be regretted that within the last few years 
these most interesting buildings have been destroyed. The 
progress of the city westwards made the site unsuitable, 
and it was sold for a railway station. But I thought at the 
time and endeavoured, ineffectually, to persuade others that, 
the removal of the college being decided on, it would not 
be impossible to remove the Fore Hall, with its staircase and 
cloisters and its noble front to the High Street, to the new 
site. I was informed, however, that the college authorities 
were advised that the architecture of the building was of a 
degraded character. The destruction of the tower, which 
was one of the land-marks of the city, seems needless. 
Railway stations need a clock-tower, and a little ingenuity 
could have made it a part of a new building. 

Old Glasgow University was a most characteristic example 



374 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



of Scotch architecture. It was without any semblance of 
fortification, which, though found in country houses of later 
date, was felt, no doubt, to be incongruous with the nature 
and purpose of the building. Though the details are 
Classic, or at least a modification of it of native growth, the 
building is more truly Gothic in the character of its archi- 
tecture, in the charming irregularity and various sizes of its 
windows, placed as convenience de- 
manded; and to me more interesting 
than the more splendid and expensive 
building which has replaced it, not- 
withstanding the elaboration and the 
correctness of its Gothic details. 

In most towns of Scotland examples 
of the style are found, dating, some 
from the seventeenth, but more com- 
monly from the eighteenth, century. 
In some of the earlier examples we 
find angle turrets and projected corbel 
courses, the reminiscences of fortifica- 
tion, but these were abandoned after 
a time. Among the most remarkable 
and the best known examples are 
the tall houses of the High Street of 
Edinburgh, some of them a dozen 
stories high. A small part of one of 
them is illustrated in fig. 130. In 
these each separate floor is a separate 
dwelling-house, which could not only 
be let, but sold, without the other floors. In this mode 
of living, Scotch and French habits are alike, and it is 
probably an instance of the influence on Scotland of French 
customs. It arose as much, perhaps, from the habit common 
to the architecture of both countries of building high as 
from scarcity of room or necessity of defence. In any case, 




Fig. 130. IN THE HIGH 
STREET, EDINBURGH. 



THE RENAISSANCE IN SCOTLAND. 375 

having become a habit in Scotland, it was continued when 
it had neither justification, even in villages and houses 
standing alone in the country. 

These Edinburgh High Street houses illustrate also a 
method of building common in Scotland, and almost peculiar 
to it, which arose from the peculiar character of the sites 
which were chosen. Scotch castles were usually placed on 
the edge of a steep hill, enclosing a courtyard on the top 
of it. The side of the building to the court was of moderate 
height, but that to the outside founded down the steep hill 
had as many stories looking out to the open, under the level 
of the inner court, as it had above it. It is this practice 
which gives to many Scotch castles their appearance of 
height and grandeur, the lower stories to the outside, 
used frequently merely as cellars and showing outside as 
solid walls forming a grand base for the building. 

The same practice was followed in building towns. They 
were commonly built along the ridge of a hill, the street 
running along the top of the ridge, with the houses on each 
side. The High Street in Edinburgh is built in this way. 
The entrance of each building, or " land," as it is called, was 
at the level of the street from which the stair descended to 
as many floors below as there were above. . 

It is to be regretted, I think, that this feature of Scotch 
architecture was not followed in the new buildings of 
Glasgow University. These occupy the summit of a hill, 
of which the top was cut down to make a level platform 
for a long low building, the height of which is further 
lessened by a wide terrace in front, which buries a great 
height of foundation wall. Had the old Scotch plan been 
followed, all this useless under building would have been 
available for admirably lighted rooms, commanding an 
extended view ; the hill, instead of being flattened, would 
have gained in height and the building would have been 
grander. 



376 



HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 



An attempt was made, not many years ago, to introduce 
into London this system of making houses of many stories, 
each of which was a single dwelling. Old habit long 
opposed the innovation, but at length the convenience and 
common sense of the arrangement has conquered. The 
toil of long stairs for approaching the house is obviated by 
lifts, while once in the house all is on one level. Houses 
convenient and of moderate size can thus be had in good 
situations, and on sites where land is valuable we may 
expect to see an extensive adoption of the system. It 
has of late had a new development in the system of 




Fig. 131. 



ORDINARY CLASSIC HOUSE. 



what are called "Mansions," like the old one of the 
Inns of Court, with the difference that the " laundresses " 
are on the premises and supposed to be at the call of 
the bell. 

It has its advantages for many people, but for families, 
especially with children, it has not always been found 
suitable. Probably something more might be done than 
has yet been accomplished to make such houses pleasant 
and suited to English habits. 

During the eighteenth century the Scotch style under- 



THE RENAISSANCE IN SCOTLAND. 377 

went considerable modifications, mainly in the direction of 
mere practical convenience and commonplaceness. Angle 
turrets disappeared, crow-steps ceased to ornament the 
gables, the only ornaments were dull classic door-pieces and 
window- frames. This common-looking house, illustrated in 
fig. 131, shows what the style had come to in the early 
part of this century. It is common builders' architecture, 
the result of old traditions, and its commonplaceness is of a 
different type from that of the English houses of the same 
date. Yet there is an air of practical good sense in it, 
more satisfactory perhaps than the more ambitious attempts 
of many modern architects. 

When the mediseval revival began to influence archi- 
tecture, the old national Scotch style of domestic architecture 
was felt to be Gothic in spirit and an adequate expression 
of the new movement. Some "even called it Gothic, and 
Mr. Kerr, in his * Gentleman's House,' considers that the 
details should be of a rude Gothic character. Had this 
been so, it would not have been adopted, as it has been, as 
the common style for country houses for the last twenty 
or thirty years. 

But "features" enough could be found in old Scotch 
to satisfy the most romantic imagination. In the old 
buildings these had always some reason in necessity or 
tradition, and were used with a moderation which makes 
the buildings look sensible and quiet. But the wonderful 
productions of modern Scotch " Baronial " seem composed 
wholly of corbels and towers, arrow-slits and pepper-boxes. 
They are all mustard with no beef. The enthusiasts for 
Scotch nationality have recently erected, as a monument to 
Wallace, a tower which alters, and some think destroys, the 
contour of a beautiful hill near Stirling. Corbelling has 
run mad in it, making marvellous protuberances where one 
does not expect them ; corners are hacked out of it, and the 
pieces stuck on somewhere else. The design seems to aim 
at being wild. 



378 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

Scarcely less wonderful is a monument lately erected to 
Burns at Kilniarnock, something between a steeple arid 
castle and a shrine to hold a statue, made up of Scotch 
corbels and turrets, and Gothic buttresses and mouldings. 

Such productions are not true expressions of national 
feeling. National peculiarities and differences have of late 
become softened down and assimilated by more frequent 
intercommunication with England and the influence of 
common culture. We should therefore expect that the 
architecture of the two countries should become assimilated, 
as in fact has happened, except in this revival of Scotch 
" Baronial," which has exaggerated the peculiarities of the 
old national style. It is like the wild spasmodic effects of 
galvanism rather than the natural outcome of life. 

The old Scotch style, when such extravagances are 
avoided, is well fitted for modern houses. Its details 
and its forms are classic, its use involves no necessity of 
changing the existing habits of the inmates, or the work- 
men's methods of building, such as was involved in the 
attempt to rein trod uce her national style of Gothic into 
England. 

In the Scotch style, mullions and narrow windows were 
not essential, and ordinary sash windows could still be used. 
Crow-steps, though an addition to the expense, did not affect 
internal arrangements, and projected angle turrets, adopted 
for the sake of appearance, could be fitted up as water- 
closets or wardrobes. It must, however, be confessed that 
recent attempts to revive the old style have too often failed 
in reproducing its artistic character. There is no lack in 
them of turrets and towers and great projections of corbels, 
but somehow these fail to produce the sternness of the old 
buildings, or the appearance of strength that would defy 
attacks. Our modern custom in country houses of placing 
the public rooms with their large windows on the ground 
floor renders this impossible. These modern "Scotch castles 
look like what they are, the mansions of rich modern 



THE RENAISSANCE IN SCOTLAND. 370 

merchants with useless extraneous features, put up for 
ornament and show. I cannot help thinking that the later 
Scotch styles of the last Stuarts and the first Georges, when 
the country had become finally settled and all idea of 
even the appearance of fortification had been abandoned, 
when windows as large as were needed were used on the 
ground-floor or wherever they were wanted, when the 
buildings were spread out in long level lines, instead of 
being piled up in great towers, as if intended to command 
the country, a style such as we saw in the old buildings 
of G-lasgow University would have been a more sensible 
model on which to found a revival.

CHAPTER 



CONCLUSION. 



THE Renaissance styles of architecture in Europe, some 
of which I have attempted I know how inadequately 
to describe, had long been considered productions of mere 
ignorance and barbarism ; offences against classic purity and 
good taste, like vulgarisms or bad grammar in language. 

But, as in language, words and expressions once thought 
vulgar have been found, on investigation, to be the natural 
outcome of historical development, I think I have shown 
that these so-called debased styles had a natural growth, 
and are subjects of historical interest. It is true they arose 
from the ignorance of correct Classic architecture in the 
builders, but this ignorance left room for the workings of 
old traditions and the natural development of new forms, 
which are more interesting and instructive than the dry 
rules of the learned. 

I have endeavoured to show how these styles grew out 
of the old Gothic traditions in each country modifying 
Classic architecture which all were compelled to adopt, to 



CONCLUSION. 381 

remove from them the reproach of being merely the 
aberrations of ignorance and stupidity, and to restore them 
to the dignity of true and natural styles of architecture. 

The state of architecture in the present day is similar to 
that which produced these national Renaissance styles. 
For thirty years we have been trained in the principles and 
the freedom of Gothic. The world can never again accept 
the dominion of classic rules ; a dominion founded on an 
ignorance which recognised no difference between the 
Greek and Roman orders, and considered the clumsy Roman 
expedient of amalgamating the Greek orders and the 
Roman arch to be the ultimate outcome of architecture. 
We accept with knowledge and consciousness the freedom 
from classic restraint which the Renaissance builders took 
unconsciously; while Classic details and Classic forms are 
the basis of our style, as they were of theirs. The attempt 
of the last thirty years to introduce the Gothic style into 
domestic and civil architecture has failed. In churches the 
case is different ; their associations and traditions are to a 
great extent mediaeval, but the traditional habits of our 
daily life are too deep-seated to be altered, and Classic has 
still remained the domestic style of the country. Let us 
accept it as the basis, the material of our style, but infuse 
into it the Gothic spirit and freedom which we have lately 
learned. 

The foregoing attempt to describe the genesis and 
character of the principal Renaissance styles of archi- 
tecture was undertaken, it may be remembered, in answer 
to the question ^ " What style of architecture is best suited 
to our use ? " 

It is a good many years now since I commenced this 
book, with the object chiefly of answering that enquiry. 
The short intervals which the practice of an architect has 
permitted me to devote to it, and the desire (which I have 
had at last to give up in despair) to make it as perfect as 



382 HOUSE ARCHITECTURE. 

I could, have delayed its appearance till the advocacy 
of my views has become useless, for the world has come 
round to them. Architects, even of the staunchest Gothic 
principles, are attempting the new style; builders are 
adopting it with enthusiasm, and more houses have been 
built in it during the last few years than the Gothic style 
produced in a generation. 

Is this merely the fashion of a day, to disappear as 
rapidly as it has arisen, an outcome of our restlessness, 
which must every year have new fashions ? I fear there 
is some risk of this. Its very popularity is its danger. 
Being freed from classic rules, there is no curb on the 
vulgarity or ignorance of those who practise it ; while in 
the old Renaissance styles the classic rules were modified 
only by deep-seated Gothic traditions. The style, especially 
in the form known as " Queen Anne," and in the " Scotch 
Baronial," gives great facilities for the expression of 
clumsiness, crude form, and vulgarity, which may make 
even good examples of it seem disgusting, and put it out 
of fashion. 

No style of architecture nowadays can continue and 
gradually develop like the old natural styles ; for in archi- 
tecture, as in ladies' dress, we have emancipated ourselves 
from tradition, arid to keep up our interest in either we 
must have perpetual variety. Instead of a development so 
slow that it was inappreciable to those who lived in it, 
and could only be measured over centuries, we must have 
obvious change every year or two. We may expect there- 
fore in architecture, as in dress, a recurrence at intervals 
to fashions lately discarded ; each, as it is taken up again, 
receiving some new form of treatment. The present fashion 
of " Queen Anne" may become so associated in our minds 
with bulbous curves and ugly forms as to cause a revulsion 
to the dignity of Italian Renaissance or to the purity and 
refinement of Greek art. When we get tired of these, when 



CONCLUSION'. 383 

we find that an Italian style is unsuited to our climate, that 
Greek architecture becomes in our hands cold and insipid, 
and gets misunderstood and vulgarised, when we find from 
experience that Englishmen are not Italians or Greeks in 
their tastes or their artistic powers, we may turn again 
with new pleasure to the cheery comfort of an English 
red-brick house. 

But any such changes of fashion, if their authority is to 
be acknowledged as binding, if they are anything more than 
the whims of a small knot of enthusiasts, must be like the 
fashions in dress ; changes within certain limits, the limits 
of our domestic habits and the traditions of the building 
trades. And these traditions are Classic. We cannot 
renounce, if we would, the inheritance of Roman forms 
which the Renaissance has bequeathed to us and to modern 
civilisation. Unwillingly, or not, we must bow to 

" Those dread unsceptred sovereigns who rule 
Our spirits from their urns."
